        <div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter there is a description of <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-dharma,</span> religious principles in devotional service that transcend religious principles for liberation and the mitigation of material misery. It is stated in this chapter that a human being should not work hard like dogs and hogs for sense gratification. The human life is especially meant for the revival of our relationship with the Supreme Lord, and to this end all kinds of austerities and penances should be accepted. By austere activities, one’s heart can be cleansed of material contamination, and as a result one can be situated on the spiritual platform. To attain this perfection, one has to take shelter of a devotee and serve him. Then the door of liberation will be open. Those who are materially attached to women and sense gratification gradually become entangled in material consciousness and suffer the miseries of birth, old age, disease and death. Those who are engaged in the general welfare of all and who are not attached to children and family are called <span class="Italic">mahātmās.</span> Those who are engaged in sense gratification. who act piously or impiously, cannot understand the purpose of the soul. Therefore they should approach a highly elevated devotee and accept him as a spiritual master. By his association, one will be able to understand the purpose of life. Under the instructions of such a spiritual master, one can attain devotional service to the Lord, detachment from material things, and tolerance of material misery and distress. One can then see all living entities equally, and one becomes very eager to know about transcendental subject matters. Endeavoring persistently for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa, one becomes detached from wife, children and home. He is not interested in wasting time. In this way one becomes self-realized. A person advanced in spiritual knowledge does not engage anyone in material activity. And one who cannot deliver another person by instructing him in devotional service should not become a spiritual master, father, mother, demigod or husband. Instructing His one hundred sons, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva advised them to accept their eldest brother, Bharata, as their guide and lord, and thereby serve him. Of all living entities, the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> are the best, and above the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> the Vaiṣṇavas are situated in an even better position. Serving a Vaiṣṇava means serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Śukadeva Gosvāmī describes the characteristics of Bharata Mahārāja and the sacrificial performance executed by Lord Ṛṣabhadeva for the instruction of the general populace.</div>

            Lord Ṛṣabhadeva told His sons: My dear boys, of all the living entities who have accepted material bodies in this world, one who has been awarded this human form should not work hard day and night simply for sense gratification, which is available even for dogs and hogs that eat stool. One should engage in penance and austerity to attain the divine position of devotional service. By such activity, one’s heart is purified, and when one attains this position, he attains eternal, blissful life, which is transcendental to material happiness and which continues forever.

          <p>
            In this verse Lord Ṛṣabhadeva tells His sons about the importance of human life. The word <span class="Italic">deha-bhāk</span> refers to anyone who accepts a material body, but the living entity who is awarded the human form must act differently from animals. Animals like dogs and hogs enjoy sense gratification by eating stool. After undergoing severe hardships all day, human beings are trying to enjoy themselves at night by eating, drinking, having sex and sleeping. At the same time, they have to properly defend themselves. However, this is not human civilization. Human life means voluntarily practicing suffering for the advancement of spiritual life. There is, of course, suffering in the lives of animals and plants, which are suffering due to their past misdeeds. However, human beings should voluntarily accept suffering in the form of austerities and penances in order to attain the divine life. After attaining the divine life, one can enjoy happiness eternally. After all, every living entity is trying to enjoy happiness, but as long as one is encaged in the material body, he has to suffer different kinds of misery. A higher sense is present in the human form. We should act according to superior advice in order to attain eternal happiness and go back to Godhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is significant in this verse that the government and the natural guardian, the father, should educate subordinates and raise them to Kṛṣṇa consciousness. Devoid of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, every living being suffers in this cycle of birth and death perpetually. To relieve them from this bondage and enable them to become blissful and happy, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> should be taught. A foolish civilization neglects to teach people how to rise to the platform of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Without Kṛṣṇa consciousness a person is no better than a hog or dog. The instructions of Ṛṣabhadeva are very essential at the present moment. People are being educated and trained to work very hard for sense gratification, and there is no sublime aim in life. A man travels to earn his livelihood, leaving home early in the morning, catching a local train and being packed in a compartment. He has to stand for an hour or two in order to reach his place of business. Then again he takes a bus to get to the office. At the office he works hard from nine to five; then he takes two or three hours to return home. After eating, he has sex and goes to sleep. For all this hardship, his only happiness is a little sex. <span class="Italic">Yan maithunādi-gṛhamedhi-sukhaṁ hi tuccham [SB </span>7.9.45]<span class="Italic">.</span> Ṛṣabhadeva clearly states that human life is not meant for this kind of existence, which is enjoyed even by dogs and hogs. Indeed, dogs and hogs do not have to work so hard for sex. A human being should try to live in a different way and should not try to imitate dogs and hogs. The alternative is mentioned. Human life is meant for <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> austerity and penance. By <span class="Italic">tapasya,</span> one can get out of the material clutches. When one is situated in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, devotional service, his happiness is guaranteed eternally. By taking to <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> devotional service, one’s existence is purified. The living entity is seeking happiness life after life, but he can make a solution to all his problems simply by practicing <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Then he immediately becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.9):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            One can attain the path of liberation from material bondage only by rendering service to highly advanced spiritual personalities. These personalities are impersonalists and devotees. Whether one wants to merge into the Lord’s existence or wants to associate with the Personality of Godhead, one should render service to the mahātmās. For those who are not interested in such activities, who associate with people fond of women and sex, the path to hell is wide open. The mahātmās are equipoised. They do not see any difference between one living entity and another. They are very peaceful and are fully engaged in devotional service. They are devoid of anger, and they work for the benefit of everyone. They do not behave in any abominable way. Such people are known as mahātmās.

          <p>
            The human body is like a junction. One may either take the path of liberation or the path leading to a hellish condition. How one can take these paths is described herein. On the path of liberation, one associate; with <span class="Italic">mahātmās,</span> and on the path of bondage one associates with those attached to sense gratification and women. There are two types of <span class="Italic">mahātmās</span>—the impersonalist and the devotee. Although their ultimate goal is different, the process of emancipation is almost the same. Both want eternal happiness. One seeks happiness in impersonal Brahman, and the other seeks happiness in the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. As described in the first verse: <span class="Italic">brahma-saukhyam.</span> Brahman means spiritual or eternal; both the impersonalist and the devotee seek eternal blissful life. In any case, it is advised that one become perfect. In the words of <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> 22.87):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">asat-saṅga-tyāga,——ei vaiṣṇava-ācāra<br>‘strī-saṅgī’——eka asādhu, ‘kṛṣṇābhakta’ āra</div>

            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            To remain unattached to the modes of material nature, one should avoid associating with those who are <span class="Italic">asat,</span> materialistic. There are two kinds of materialists. One is attached to women and sense gratification, and the other is simply a nondevotee. On the positive side is association with <span class="Italic">mahātmās,</span> and on the negative side is the avoidance of nondevotees and women-hunters.

            Those who are interested in reviving Kṛṣṇa consciousness and increasing their love of Godhead do not like to do anything that is not related to Kṛṣṇa. They are not interested in mingling with people who are busy maintaining their bodies, eating, sleeping, mating and defending. They are not attached to their homes, although they may be householders. Nor are they attached to wives, children, friends or wealth. At the same time, they are not indifferent to the execution of their duties.

Those who are interested in spiritual life should not be attached to homely comforts in the company of wife. children, friends and so forth. Even if one is a <span class="Italic">gṛhastha</span> and has to earn his livelihood, he should be satisfied by collecting only enough money to maintain body and soul together. One should not have more than that nor less than that.

            When a person considers sense gratification the aim of life, he certainly becomes mad after materialistic living and engages in all kinds of sinful activity. He does not know that due to his past misdeeds he has already received a body which, although temporary, is the cause of his misery. Actually the living entity should not have taken on a material body, but he has been awarded the material body for sense gratification. Therefore I think it not befitting an intelligent man to involve himself again in the activities of sense gratification by which he perpetually gets material bodies one after another.

            Begging, borrowing and stealing to live for sense gratification is condemned in this verse because such consciousness leads one to a dark, hellish condition. The four sinful activities are illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. These are the means by which one gets another material body that is full of miseries. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said: <span class="Italic">asaṅgo hy ayaṁ puruṣaḥ.</span> The living entity is not really connected with this material world, but due to his tendency to enjoy the material senses. he is put into the material condition. One should perfect his life by associating with devotees. He should not become further implicated in the material body.

            As long as one does not inquire about the spiritual values of life, one is defeated and subjected to miseries arising from ignorance. Be it sinful or pious, karma has its resultant actions. If a person is engaged in any kind of karma, his mind is called karmātmaka, colored with fruitive activity. As long as the mind is impure, consciousness is unclear, and as long as one is absorbed in fruitive activity, he has to accept a material body.

            Generally people think that one should act very piously in order to be relieved from misery, but this is not a fact. Even though one engages in pious activity and speculation. he is nonetheless defeated. His only aim should be emancipation from the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> and all material activities. Speculative knowledge and pious activity do not solve the problems of material life. One should be inquisitive to understand his spiritual position. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.37):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

          <p>
            Unless one understands the self and its activities, one has to be considered in material bondage. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (10.2.32) it is also said: <span class="Italic">ye ’nye ’ravindākṣa vimukta-māninas tvayy asta-bhāvād aviśuddha-buddhayaḥ.</span> A person who doesn’t have knowledge of devotional service may think himself liberated, but actually he is not. <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padaṁ tataḥ patanty adho ’nādṛta-yuṣmad-aṅghrayaḥ: [SB </span>10.2.32] such people may approach the impersonal Brahman effulgence, but they fall down again into material enjoyment because they have no knowledge of devotional service.

            When the living entity is covered by the mode of ignorance, he does not understand the individual living being and the supreme living being, and his mind is subjugated to fruitive activity.

            When the mind is polluted by fruitive activity, the living entity wants to be elevated from one material position to another. Generally everyone is involved in working hard day and night to improve his economic condition. Even when one understands the Vedic rituals, he becomes interested in promotion to heavenly planets, not knowing that one’s real interest lies in returning home, back to Godhead. By acting on the platform of fruitive activity, one wanders throughout the universe in different species and forms. Unless he comes in contact with a devotee of the Lord, a <span class="Italic">guru,</span> he does not become attached to the service of Lord Vāsudeva. Knowledge of Vāsudeva requires many births to understand. As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.19): <span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ.</span> After struggling for existence for many births one may take shelter at the lotus feet of Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa.

            The attraction between male and female is the basic principle of material existence. On the basis of this misconception, which ties together the hearts of the male and female, one becomes attracted to his body, home, property, children, relatives and wealth.

            Sex serves as the natural attraction between man and woman, and when they are married, their relationship becomes more involved. Due to the entangling relationship between man and woman, there is a sense of illusion whereby one thinks, “This man is my husband,” or “This woman is my wife.” This is called <span class="Italic">hṛdaya-granthi,</span> “the hard knot in the heart.” This knot is very difficult to undo, even though a man and woman separate either for the principles of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> or simply to get a divorce. In any case, the man always thinks of the woman, and the woman always thinks of the man. Thus a person becomes materially attached to family, property and children, although all of these are temporary. The possessor unfortunately identifies with his property and wealth. Sometimes, even after renunciation, one becomes attached to a temple or to the few things that constitute the property of a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī,</span> but such attachment is not as strong as family attachment. The attachment to the family is the strongest illusion. In the <span class="Italic">Satya-saṁhitā,</span> it is stated:

            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            Sometimes it is found among exalted personalities like Lord Brahmā that the wife and children are not a cause of bondage.

            O My sons, you should accept a highly elevated paramahaṁsa, a spiritually advanced spiritual master. In this way, you should place your faith and love in Me, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You should detest sense gratification and tolerate the duality of pleasure and pain, which are like the seasonal changes of summer and winter. Try to realize the miserable condition of living entities, who are miserable even in the higher planetary systems. Philosophically inquire about the truth. Then undergo all kinds of austerities and penances for the sake of devotional service. Give up the endeavor for sense enjoyment and engage in the service of the Lord. Listen to discussions about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and always associate with devotees. Chant about and glorify the Supreme Lord, and look upon everyone equally on the spiritual platform. Give up enmity and subdue anger and lamentation. Abandon identifying the self with the body and the home, and practice reading the revealed scriptures. Live in a secluded place and practice the process by which you can completely control your life air, mind and senses. Have full faith in the revealed scriptures, the Vedic literatures, and always observe celibacy. Perform your prescribed duties and avoid unnecessary talks. Always thinking of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, acquire knowledge from the right source. Thus practicing bhakti-yoga, you will patiently and enthusiastically be elevated in knowledge and will be able to give up the false ego.

            In these four verses, Ṛṣabhadeva tells His sons how they can be freed from the false identification arising from false ego and material conditional life. One gradually becomes liberated by practicing as mentioned above. All these prescribed methods enable one to give up the material body (<span class="Italic">liṅgaṁ vyapohet</span>) and be situated in his original spiritual body. First of all one has to accept a bona fide spiritual master. This is advocated by Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī in his <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu:</span> <span class="Italic">śrī-guru-pādāśrayaḥ.</span> To be freed from the entanglement of the material world, one has to approach a spiritual master. <span class="Italic">Tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet </span><span class="Ref_Italic">[MU</span> <popup><div class="Verse">tad-vijñānārthaṁ sa gurum evābhigacchet<br>samit-pāṇiḥ śrotriyaṁ brahma-niṣṭham</div></popup>

            “To understand these things properly, one must humbly approach, with firewood in hand, a spiritual master who is learned in the <i>Vedas</i> and firmly devoted to the Absolute Truth.” <br><span class="Ref_Italic">[Muṇḍaka Upaniṣad</span> 1.2.12]
          </p>
          <p>
            <lt>1.2.12]<span class="Italic">.</span> By questioning the spiritual master and by serving him, one can advance in spiritual life. When one engages in devotional service, naturally the attraction for personal comfort—for eating, sleeping and dressing—is reduced. By associating with the devotee, a spiritual standard is maintained. The word <span class="Italic">mad-deva-saṅgāt</span> is very important. There are many so-called religions devoted to the worship of various demigods, but here good association means association with one who simply accepts Kṛṣṇa as his worshipable Deity.</lt>
          </p>
          <p>
            Another important item is <span class="Italic">dvandva-titikṣā.</span> As long as one is situated in the material world, there must be pleasure and pain arising from the material body. As Kṛṣṇa advises in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">tāṁs titikṣasva bhārata.</span> One has to learn how to tolerate the temporary pains and pleasures of this material world. One must also be detached from his family and practice celibacy. Sex with one’s wife according to the scriptural injunctions is also accepted as <span class="Italic">brahmacarya</span> (celibacy), but illicit sex is opposed to religious principles, and it hampers advancement in spiritual consciousness. Another important word is <span class="Italic">vijñāna-virājita.</span> Everything should be done very scientifically and consciously. One should be a realized soul. In this way, one can give up the entanglement of material bondage.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Śrī Madhvācārya points out, the sum and substance of these four <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> is that one should refrain from acting out of a desire for sense gratification and should instead always engage in the Lord’s loving service. In other words, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is the acknowledged path of liberation. Śrīla Madhvācārya quotes from the <span class="Italic">Adhyātma:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">ātmano ’vihitaṁ karma<br>varjayitvānya-karmaṇaḥ<br>kāmasya ca parityāgo<br>nirīhety āhur uttamāḥ</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            One should perform activities only for the benefit of the soul; any other activity should be given up. When a person is situated in this way, he is said to be desireless. Actually a living entity cannot be totally desireless, but when he desires the benefit of the soul and nothing else, he is said to be desireless.

            Spiritual knowledge is <span class="Italic">jñāna-vijñāna-samanvitam.</span> When one is fully equipped with <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> and <span class="Italic">vijñāna,</span> he is perfect. <span class="Italic">Jñāna</span> means that one understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, to be the Supreme Being. <span class="Italic">Vijñāna</span> refers to the activities that liberate one from the ignorance of material existence. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (2.9.31): <span class="Italic">jñānaṁ parama-guhyaṁ me yad vijñāna-samanvitam.</span> Knowledge of the Supreme Lord is very confidential, and the supreme knowledge by which one understands Him furthers the liberation of all living entities. This knowledge is <span class="Italic">vijñāna.</span> As confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.9):

            The idea is to enter into the <span class="Italic">parā bhakti,</span> the transcendental devotional service of the Supreme Lord. To attain this, one must analyze ones existence, but when one is actually engaged in devotional service, he should not bother seeking out knowledge. By simply engaging in devotional service undeviatingly, one will always remain in the liberated condition.

            Due to ignorance, the materialistic person does not know anything about his real self-interest, the auspicious path in life. He is simply bound to material enjoyment by lusty desires, and all his plans are made for this purpose. For temporary sense gratification, such a person creates a society of envy, and due to this mentality, he plunges into the ocean of suffering. Such a foolish person does not even know about this.

            The word <span class="Italic">naṣṭa-dṛṣṭiḥ,</span> meaning “one who has no eyes to see the future,” is very significant in this verse. Life goes on from one body to another, and the activities performed in this life are enjoyed or suffered in the next life, if not later in this life. One who is unintelligent, who has no eyes to see the future, simply creates enmity and fights with others for sense gratification. As a result, one suffers in the next life, but due to being like a blind man, he continues to act in such a way that he suffers unlimitedly. Such a person is a <span class="Italic">mūḍha,</span> one who simply wastes his time and does not understand the Lord’s devotional service.

            There are many spiritual masters, but Ṛṣabhadeva advises that one should not become a spiritual master if he is unable to save his disciple from the path of birth and death. Unless one is a pure devotee of Kṛṣṇa, he cannot save himself from the path of repeated birth and death. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so’rjuna [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span> One can stop birth and death only by returning home, back to Godhead. However, who can go back to Godhead unless he understands the Supreme Lord in truth? <span class="Italic">Janma karma ca me divyam evaṁ yo vetti tattvataḥ [Bg. </span>4.9]<span class="Italic">.</span>

          <p>
            We have many instances in history illustrating Ṛṣabhadeva’s instructions. Śukrācārya was rejected by Bali Mahārāja due to his inability to save Bali Mahārāja from the path of repeated birth and death. Śukrācārya was not a pure devotee, he was more or less inclined to fruitive activity, and he objected when Bali Mahārāja promised to give everything to Lord Viṣṇu. Actually one is supposed to give everything to the Lord because everything belongs to the Lord. Consequently, the Supreme Lord advises in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.27):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            “O son of Kuntī, all that you do, all that you eat, all that you offer and give away, as well as all austerities that you may perform, should be done as an offering unto Me.” This is <span class="Italic">bhakti.</span> Unless one is devoted, he cannot give everything to the Supreme Lord. Unless one can do so, he cannot become a spiritual master, husband, father or mother. Similarly, the wives of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> who were performing sacrifices gave up their relatives just to satisfy Kṛṣṇa. This is an example of a wife rejecting a husband who cannot deliver her from the impending dangers of birth and death. Similarly, Prahlāda Mahārāja rejected his father, and Bharata Mahārāja rejected his mother (<span class="Italic">jananī na sā syāt</span>). The word <span class="Italic">daivam</span> indicates a demigod or one who accepts worship from a dependent. Ordinarily, the spiritual master, husband, father, mother or superior relative accepts worship from an inferior relative, but here Ṛṣabhadeva forbids this. First the father, spiritual master or husband must be able to release the dependent from repeated birth and death. If he cannot do this, he plunges himself into the ocean of reproachment for his unlawful activities. Everyone should be very responsible and take charge of his dependents just as a spiritual master takes charge of his disciple or a father takes charge of his son. All these responsibilities cannot be discharged honestly unless one can save the dependent from repeated birth and death.

            My transcendental body [sac-cid-ānanda-vigraha [Bs. 5.1]] looks exactly like a human form, but it is not a material human body. It is inconceivable. I am not forced by nature to accept a particular type of body; I take on a body by My own sweet will. My heart is also spiritual, and I always think of the welfare of My devotees. Therefore within My heart can be found the process of devotional service, which is meant for the devotees. Far from My heart have I abandoned irreligion [adharma] and nondevotional activities. They do not appeal to Me. Due to all these transcendental qualities, people generally pray to Me as Ṛṣabhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the best of all living entities.

            In this verse the words <span class="Italic">idaṁ śarīraṁ mama durvibhāvyam</span> are very significant. Generally we experience two energies—material energy and spiritual energy. We have some experience of the material energy (earth. water, air, fire, ether, mind, intelligence and ego) because in the material world everyone’s body is composed of these elements. Within the material body is the spirit soul, but we cannot see it with the material eyes. When we see a body full of spiritual energy, it is very difficult for us to understand how the spiritual energy can have a body. It is said that Lord Ṛṣabhadeva’s body is completely spiritual; therefore for a materialistic person, it is very difficult to understand. For a materialistic person, the completely spiritual body is inconceivable. We have to accept the version of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> when our experimental perception cannot understand a subject. As stated in <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā:</span> <span class="Italic">īśvaraḥ paramaḥ kṛṣṇaḥ sac-cid-ānanda-vigrahaḥ [Bs. </span>5.1]<span class="Italic">.</span> The Supreme Lord has a body with form, but that body is not composed of material elements. It is made of spiritual bliss, eternity and living force. By the inconceivable energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord can appear before us in His original spiritual body, but because we have no experience of the spiritual body, we are sometimes bewildered and see the form of the Lord as material. The Māyāvādī philosophers are completely unable to conceive of a spiritual body. They say that the spirit is always impersonal, and whenever they see something personal, they take it for granted that it is material. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.11) it is said:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            Unintelligent people think that the Supreme Lord accepts a body composed of the material energy. We can easily understand the material body, but we cannot understand the spiritual body. Therefore Ṛṣabhadeva says: <span class="Italic">idaṁ śarīraṁ mama durvibhāvyam.</span> In the spiritual world, everyone has a spiritual body. There is no conception of material existence there. In the spiritual world there is only service and the receiving of service. There is only <span class="Italic">sevya, sevā,</span> and <span class="Italic">sevaka</span>—the person served, the process of service and the servant. These three items are completely spiritual, and therefore the spiritual world is called absolute. There is no tinge of material contamination there. Being completely transcendental to the material conception, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva states that His heart is composed of <span class="Italic">dharma.</span> <span class="Italic">Dharma</span> is explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (18.66): <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> In the spiritual world, every living entity is surrendered to the Supreme Lord and is completely on the spiritual platform. Although there are servitors, the served and service, all are spiritual and variegated. At the present moment, due to our material conception. everything is <span class="Italic">durvibhāvya,</span> inconceivable. Being the Supreme, the Lord is called Ṛṣabha, the best. In terms of the Vedic language, <span class="Italic">nityo nityānām.</span> We are also spiritual. but we are subordinate. Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Lord, is the foremost living entity. The word <span class="Italic">ṛṣabha</span> means “the chief,” or “the supreme,” and indicates the Supreme Being, or God Himself.

            In this verse the word <span class="Italic">hṛdaya</span> indicates the heart, which is also called <span class="Italic">uraḥ,</span> the chest. The heart is situated within the chest, and although instrumentally the son is born with the aid of the genitals, he is actually born from within the heart. According to the heart’s situation. the semen takes the form of a body. Therefore according to the Vedic system, when one begets a child his heart should be purified through the ritualistic ceremony known as <span class="Italic">garbhādhāna.</span> Ṛṣabhadeva’s heart was always uncontaminated and spiritual. Consequently all the sons born from the heart of Ṛṣabhadeva were spiritually inclined. Nonetheless. Ṛṣabhadeva suggested that His eldest son was superior, and He advised the others to serve him. All the brothers of Bharata Mahārāja were advised by Ṛṣabhadeva to adhere to Bharata’s service. The question may be asked why one should be attached to family members, for in the beginning it was advised that one should not be attached to home and family. However, it is also advised, <span class="Italic">mahīyasām pāda-rajo-’bhiṣeka</span>—one has to serve the <span class="Italic">mahīyān,</span> one who is very spiritually advanced. <span class="Italic">Mahat-sevāṁ dvāram āhur vimukteḥ: [SB </span>5.5.2] by serving the <span class="Italic">mahat,</span> the exalted devotee, one’s path for liberation is open. The family of Ṛṣabhadeva should not be compared to an ordinary materialistic family. Bharata Mahārāja, Ṛṣabhadeva’s eldest son, was specifically very exalted. For this reason the other sons were advised to serve him for his pleasure. That was to be their duty.

            The Supreme Lord was advising Bharata Mahārāja to be the chief ruler of the planet. This is the real plan of the Supreme Lord. In the Battle of Kurukṣetra, we find that Lord Kṛṣṇa wanted Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira to be the supreme emperor of this planet. He never wanted Duryodhana to take the post. As stated in the previous verse, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva’s heart is <span class="Italic">hṛdayaṁ yatra dharmaḥ.</span> The characteristic <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is also explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> surrender unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. To protect <span class="Italic">dharma</span> (<span class="Italic">paritrāṇāya sādhūnām</span>), the Lord always wants the ruler of the earth to be a devotee. Then everything goes on nicely for the benefit of everyone. As soon as a demon rules the earth, everything becomes chaotic. At the present moment, the world is inclined toward the democratic process, but the people in general are all contaminated by the modes of passion and ignorance. Consequently they cannot select the right person to head the government. The president is selected by the votes of ignorant <span class="Italic">śūdras;</span> therefore another <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> is elected, and immediately the entire government becomes polluted. If people strictly followed the principles of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">they</span> would elect a person who is the Lord’s devotee. Then automatically there would be good government. Ṛṣabhadeva therefore recommended Bharata Mahārāja as the emperor of this planet. Serving a devotee means serving the Supreme Lord, for a devotee always represents the Lord. When a devotee is in charge, the government is always congenial and beneficial for everyone.

            In this verse, the evolutionary process is indirectly mentioned. The modern theory that life evolves from matter is to some extent supported in this verse because it is stated, <span class="Italic">bhūteṣu vīrudbhyaḥ.</span> That is, the living entities evolve from vegetables, grass, plants and trees, which are superior to dull matter. In other words, matter also has the potency to manifest living entities in the form of vegetables. In this sense, life comes out of matter, but matter also comes out of life. As Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.8), <span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavo mattaḥ sarvaṁ pravartate:</span> “I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            There are two energies—material and spiritual—and both originally come from Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is the supreme living being. Although it may be said that in the material world a living force is generated from matter, it must be admitted that originally matter is generated from the supreme living being. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.</span> The conclusion is that everything, both material and spiritual, is generated from the Supreme Being. From the evolutionary point of view, perfection is reached when the living entity attains the platform of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> <span class="Italic">A brāhmaṇa</span> is a worshiper of the Supreme Brahman, and the Supreme Brahman worships the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa.</span> In other words, the devotee is subordinate to the Supreme Lord, and the Lord is inclined to see to the satisfaction of His devotee. A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> is called <span class="Italic">dvija-deva,</span> and the Lord is called <span class="Italic">dvija-deva-deva.</span> He is the Lord of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            The evolutionary process is also explained in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> (<span class="Italic">Madhya,</span> Chapter Nineteen), wherein it is said that there are two types of living entities—moving and nonmoving. Among moving entities. there are birds, beasts. aquatics, human beings and so on. Of these. the human beings are supposed to be the best, but they are few. Of these small numbers of human beings, there are many low-class human beings like <span class="Italic">mlecchas,</span> Pulindas, <span class="Italic">bauddhas</span> and <span class="Italic">śabaras.</span> The human being elevated enough to accept the Vedic principles is superior. Among those who accept the Vedic principles generally known as <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span> (presently known as the Hindu system), few actually follow these principles. Of those who actually follow the Vedic principles, most perform fruitive activity or pious activity for elevation to a high position. <span class="Italic">Manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye: [Bg. 7.3]</span> out of many attached to fruitive activity, one may be a <span class="Italic">jñānī</span>—that is, one philosophically inclined and superior to the <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> <span class="Italic">Yatatām api siddhānāṁ kaścin māṁ vetti tattvataḥ: [Bg. 7.3]</span> out of many <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> one may be liberated from material bondage, and out of many millions of liberated <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> one may become a devotee of Kṛṣṇa.

            The Vedas are My eternal transcendental sound incarnation. Therefore the Vedas are śabda-brahma. In this world, the brāhmaṇas thoroughly study all the Vedas, and because they assimilate the Vedic conclusions, they are also to be considered the Vedas personified. The brāhmaṇas are situated in the supreme transcendental mode of nature—sattva-guṇa. Because of this, they are fixed in mind control [śama], sense control [dama], and truthfulness [satya]. They describe the Vedas in their original sense, and out of mercy [anugraha] they preach the purpose of the Vedas to all conditioned souls. They practice penance [tapasya] and tolerance [titikṣā], and they realize the position of the living entity and the Supreme Lord [anubhava]. These are the eight qualifications of the brāhmaṇas. Therefore among all living entities, no one is superior to the brāhmaṇas.

We even offer respects to a temple from a distant place, and all living entities should similarly be offered respect.

            Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: Thus the great well-wisher of everyone, the Supreme Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, instructed His own sons. Although they were perfectly educated and cultured, He instructed them just to set an example of how a father should instruct his sons before retiring from family life. Sannyāsīs, who are no longer bound by fruitive activity and who have taken to devotional service after all their material desires have been vanquished, also learn by these instructions. Lord Ṛṣabhadeva instructed His one hundred sons, of whom the eldest, Bharata, was a very advanced devotee and a follower of Vaiṣṇavas. In order to rule the whole world, the Lord enthroned His eldest son on the royal seat. Thereafter, although still at home, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva lived like a madman, naked and with disheveled hair. Then the Lord took the sacrificial fire within Himself, and He left Brahmāvarta to tour the whole world.

Wherever He traveled, all bad elements surrounded Him, just as flies surround the body of an elephant coming from a forest. He was always being threatened, beaten, urinated upon and spat upon. Sometimes people threw stones, stool and dust at Him, and sometimes people passed foul air before Him. Thus people called Him many bad names and gave Him a great deal of trouble, but He did not care about this, for He understood that the body is simply meant for such an end. He was situated on the spiritual platform, and, being in His spiritual glory, He did not care for all these material insults. In other words, He completely understood that matter and spirit are separate, and He had no bodily conception. Thus, without being angry at anyone, He walked through the whole world alone.

            Although Lord Ṛṣabhadeva’s body was very much neglected, His transcendental features were so attractive that even married women were attracted to Him. His beauty and dirtiness combined to make His beautiful body appear as though it were haunted by a ghost.

            When Lord Ṛṣabhadeva saw that the general populace was very antagonistic to His execution of mystic yoga, He accepted the behavior of a python in order to counteract their opposition. Thus He stayed in one place and lay down. While lying down, He ate and drank, and He passed stool and urine and rolled in it. Indeed, He smeared His whole body with His own stool and urine so that opposing elements might not come and disturb Him.

            According to one’s destiny, one enjoys allotted happiness and distress, even though one keeps himself in one place. This is the injunction of the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> When one is spiritually situated, he may stay in one place, and all his necessities will be supplied by the arrangement of the supreme controller. Unless one is a preacher, there is no need to travel all over the world. A person can stay in one place and execute devotional service suitably according to time and circumstance. When Ṛṣabhadeva saw that He was simply being disturbed by traveling throughout the world, He decided to lie down in one place like a python. Thus He ate, drank, and He passed stool and urine and smeared His body with them so that people would not disturb Him.

            Because Lord Ṛṣabhadeva remained in that condition, the public did not disturb Him, but no bad aroma emanated from His stool and urine. Quite the contrary, His stool and urine were so aromatic that they filled eighty miles of the countryside with a pleasant fragrance.

            From this we can certainly assume that Lord Ṛṣabhadeva was transcendentally blissful. His stool and urine were so completely different from material stool and urine that they were aromatic. Even in the material world, cow dung is accepted as purified and antiseptic. A person can keep stacks of cow dung in one place, and it will not create a bad odor to disturb anyone. We can take it for granted that in the spiritual world, stool and urine are also pleasantly scented. Indeed, the entire atmosphere became very pleasant due to Lord Ṛṣabhadeva’s stool and urine.

            In this way Lord Ṛṣabhadeva followed the behavior of cows, deer and crows. Sometimes He moved or walked, and sometimes He sat down in one place. Sometimes He lay down, behaving exactly like cows, deer and crows. In that way, He ate, drank, passed stool and urine and cheated the people in this way.

            Being the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva possessed a transcendental, spiritual body.

            O King Parīkṣit, just to show all the yogīs the mystic process, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, the partial expansion of Lord Kṛṣṇa, performed wonderful activities. Actually He was the master of liberation and was fully absorbed in transcendental bliss, which increased a thousandfold. Lord Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, the son of Vasudeva, is the original source of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva. There is no difference in Their constitution, and consequently Lord Ṛṣabhadeva awakened the loving symptoms of crying, laughing and shivering. He was always absorbed in transcendental love. Due to this, all mystic powers automatically approached Him, such as the ability to travel in outer space at the speed of mind, to appear and disappear, to enter the bodies of others, and to see things far, far away. Although He could do all this, He did not exercise these powers.

            In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> 19.149) it is said:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">kṛṣṇa-bhakta——niṣkāma, ataeva ‘śānta’<br>bhukti-mukti-siddhi-kāmī——sakali ‘aśānta’</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            The word <span class="Italic">śānta</span> means completely peaceful. Unless all one’s desires are fulfilled, one cannot be peaceful. Everyone is trying to fulfill his aspirations and desires, be they material or spiritual. Those in the material world are <span class="Italic">aśānta</span> (without peace) because they have so many desires to fulfill. The pure devotee, however, is without desire. <span class="Italic">Anyābhilāṣitā-śūnya:</span> a pure devotee is completely free from all kinds of material desire. <span class="Italic">Karmīs,</span> on the other hand, are simply full of desires because they try to enjoy sense gratification. They are not peaceful in this life, nor the next, during the past, present or future. Similarly, <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> are always aspiring after liberation and trying to become one with the Supreme. <span class="Italic">Yogīs</span> are aspiring after many <span class="Italic">siddhis</span> (powers)—<span class="Italic">aṇimā, laghimā, prāpti,</span> etc. However, a devotee is not at all interested in these things because he is fully dependent on the mercy of Kṛṣṇa. Kṛṣṇa is <span class="Italic">yogeśvara,</span> the possessor of all mystic powers (<span class="Italic">siddhis</span>), and He is <span class="Italic">ātmārāma,</span> fully self-satisfied. The <span class="Italic">yoga-siddhis</span> are described in this verse. One can fly in outer space without the aid of a machine, and he can travel at the speed of mind. This means that as soon as a <span class="Italic">yogī</span> desires to go somewhere within this universe or even beyond this universe, he can do so immediately. One cannot estimate the speed of mind, for within a second the mind can go many millions of miles. Sometimes <span class="Italic">yogīs</span> enter into the bodies of other people and act as they desire when their bodies are not working properly. When the body becomes old, a perfect <span class="Italic">yogī</span> can find a young, able body. Giving up his old body, the <span class="Italic">yogī</span> can enter into the young body and act as he pleases. Being a plenary expansion of Lord Vāsudeva, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva possessed all these mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> powers, but He was satisfied with His devotional love of Kṛṣṇa, which was evinced by the ecstatic symptoms, such as crying, laughing and shivering.

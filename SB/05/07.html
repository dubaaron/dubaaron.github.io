      <div class="summary">
        <div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, the activities of King Bharata Mahārāja, the emperor of the whole world, are described. Bharata Mahārāja performed various ritualistic ceremonies (Vedic <span class="Italic">yajñas</span>) and satisfied the Supreme Lord by his different modes of worship. In due course of time, he left home and resided in Hardwar and passed his days in devotional activities. Being ordered by his father, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, Bharata Mahārāja married Pañcajanī, the daughter of Viśvarūpa. After this, he ruled the whole world peacefully. Formerly this planet was known as Ajanābha, and after the reign of Bharata Mahārāja it became known as Bhārata-varṣa. Bharata Mahārāja begot five sons in the womb of Pañcajanī, and he named the sons Sumati, Rāṣṭrabhṛta, Sudarśana, Āvaraṇa and Dhūmraketu. Bharata Mahārāja was very rigid in executing religious principles and following in the footsteps of his father. He therefore ruled the citizens very successfully. Because he performed various <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> to satisfy the Supreme Lord, he was personally very satisfied. Being of undisturbed mind, he increased his devotional activities unto Lord Vāsudeva. Bharata Mahārāja was competent in understanding the principles of saintly persons like Nārada, and he followed in the footsteps of the sages. He also kept Lord Vāsudeva constantly within his heart. After finishing his kingly duties, he divided his kingdom among his five sons. He then left home and went to the place of Pulaha known as Pulahāśrama. There he ate forest vegetables and fruits, and worshiped Lord Vāsudeva with everything available. Thus he increased his devotion toward Vāsudeva, and he automatically began to realize further his transcendental, blissful life. Due to his highly advanced spiritual position, there were sometimes visible in his body the <span class="Italic">aṣṭa-sāttvika</span> transformations, such as ecstatic crying and bodily trembling, which are symptoms of love of Godhead. It is understood that Mahārāja Bharata worshiped the Supreme Lord with the <span class="Italic">mantras</span> mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Ṛg Veda,</span> generally known as Gāyatrī <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> which aim at the Supreme Nārāyaṇa situated within the sun.</div>

            Śukadeva Gosvāmī continued speaking to Mahārāja Parīkṣit: My dear King, Bharata Mahārāja was a topmost devotee. Following the orders of his father, who had already decided to install him on the throne, he began to rule the earth accordingly. When Bharata Mahārāja ruled the entire globe, he followed the orders of his father and married Pañcajanī, the daughter of Viśvarūpa.

            With great faith King Bharata performed various kinds of sacrifice. He performed the sacrifices known as agni-hotra, darśa, pūrṇamāsa, cāturmāsya, paśu-yajña [wherein a horse is sacrificed] and soma-yajña [wherein a kind of beverage is offered]. Sometimes these sacrifices were performed completely and sometimes partially. In any case, in all the sacrifices the regulations of cāturhotra were strictly followed. In this way Bharata Mahārāja worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            Animals like hogs and cows were offered in sacrifice to test the proper execution of the sacrifice. Otherwise, there was no purpose in killing the animal. Actually the animal was offered in the sacrificial fire to get a rejuvenated life. Generally an old animal was sacrificed in the fire. and it would come out again in a youthful body. Some of the rituals however, did not require animal sacrifice. In the present age, animal sacrifices are forbidden. As stated by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu:
          </p>

            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            “In this age of Kali, five acts are forbidden: the offering of a horse in sacrifice, the offering of a cow in sacrifice, the acceptance of the order of <span class="Italic">sannyāsa,</span> the offering of oblations of flesh to the forefathers, and a man’s begetting children in his brother’s wife.” (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Ādi</span> 17.164) Such sacrifices are impossible in this age due to the scarcity of expert <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas</span> or <span class="Italic">ṛtvijaḥ</span> who are able to take the responsibility. In the absence of these, the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> is recommended. <span class="Italic">Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 11.5.32). After all, sacrifices are executed to please the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Yajñārtha-karma:</span> such activities should be carried out for the Supreme Lord’s pleasure. In this age of Kali, the Supreme Lord in His incarnation of Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu should be worshiped with His associates by performance of <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña,</span> the congregational chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> This process is accepted by intelligent men. <span class="Italic">Yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyair yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ.</span> The word <span class="Italic">sumedhasaḥ</span> refers to intelligent men who possess very good brain substance.

            After performing the preliminaries of various sacrifices, Mahārāja Bharata offered the results in the name of religion to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva. In other words, he performed all the yajñas for the satisfaction of Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa. Mahārāja Bharata thought that since the demigods were different parts of Vāsudeva’s body, He controls those who are explained in the Vedic mantras. By thinking in this way, Mahārāja Bharata was freed from all material contamination, such as attachment, lust and greed. When the priests were about to offer the sacrificial ingredients into the fire, Mahārāja Bharata expertly understood how the offering made to different demigods was simply an offering to the different limbs of the Lord. For instance, Indra is the arm of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Sūrya [the sun] is His eye. Thus Mahārāja Bharata considered that the oblations offered to different demigods were actually offered unto the different limbs of Lord Vāsudeva.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_6_purport">
          <p>
            The Supreme Personality of Godhead says that as long as one does not develop the pure devotional service of <span class="Italic">śravaṇaṁ kīrtanam,</span> hearing and chanting, one must carry out his prescribed duties. Since Bharata Mahārāja was a great devotee, one may ask why he performed so many sacrifices that are actually meant for <span class="Italic">karmīs.</span> The fact is that he was simply following the orders of Vāsudeva. As Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> <span class="Italic">sarva dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja:</span> “Abandon all varieties of religion and just surrender unto Me.” (Bg. 18.66) Whatever we do, we should constantly remember Vāsudeva. People are generally addicted to offering obeisances to various demigods, but Bharata Mahārāja simply wanted to please Lord Vāsudeva. As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> <span class="Italic">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram</span> (Bg. 5.29). A <span class="Italic">yajña</span> may be carried out to satisfy a particular demigod, but when the <span class="Italic">yajña is</span> offered to the <span class="Italic">yajña-puruṣa,</span> Nārāyaṇa, the demigods are satisfied. The purpose of performing different <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> is to satisfy the Supreme Lord. One may perform them in the name of different demigods or directly. If we directly offer oblations to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the demigods are automatically satisfied. If we water the root of a tree, the branches, twigs, fruits and flowers are automatically satisfied. When one offers sacrifices to different demigods, one should remember that the demigods are simply parts of the body of the Supreme. If we worship the hand of a person, we intend to satisfy the person himself. If we massage a person’s legs, we do not really serve the legs but the person who possesses the legs. All the demigods are different parts of the Lord, and if we offer service to them, we actually serve the Lord Himself. Demigod worship is mentioned in <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā, but</span> actually the <span class="Italic">ślokas</span> advocate worship of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda. For instance, worship of the goddess Durgā is mentioned this way in <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> (5.44):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">sṛṣṭi-sthiti-pralaya-sādhana-śaktir ekā<br>chāyeva yasya bhuvanāni vibharti durgā<br>icchānurūpam api yasya ca ceṣṭate sā<br>govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the orders of Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the goddess Durgā creates, maintains and annihilates. Śrī Kṛṣṇa also confirms this statement in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:</span> “This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings.” (Bg. 9.10)
          </p>
          <p>
            We should worship the demigods in that spirit. Because the goddess Durgā satisfies Kṛṣṇa, we should therefore offer respects to goddess Durgā. Because Lord Śiva is nothing but Kṛṣṇa’s functional body, we should therefore offer respects to Lord Śiva. Similarly, we should offer respects to Brahmā, Agni and Sūrya. There are many offerings to different demigods, and one should always remember that these offerings are usually meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Bharata Mahārāja did not aspire to receive some benediction from demigods. His aim was to please the Supreme Lord. In the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> among the thousand names of Viṣṇu, it is said <span class="Italic">yajña-bhug yajña-kṛd yajñaḥ.</span> <span class="Italic">The</span> enjoyer of <span class="Italic">yajña, the</span> performer of <span class="Italic">yajña and yajña</span> itself are the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is the performer of everything, but out of ignorance the living entity thinks that he is the actor. As long as we think we are the actors, we bring about <span class="Italic">karma-bandha</span> (bondage to activity). If we act for <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> for Kṛṣṇa. there is no <span class="Italic">karma-bandha.</span> <span class="Italic">Yajñārthāt karmaṇo ’nyatra loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ: [Bg. 3.9]</span>) “Work done as a sacrifice for Viṣṇu has to be performed. otherwise work binds one to this material world.” (Bg. 3.9)
          </p>
          <p>
            Following the instructions of Bharata Mahārāja, we should act not for our personal satisfaction but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (17.28) it is also stated:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">aśraddhayā hutaṁ dattaṁ<br>tapas taptaṁ kṛtaṁ ca yat<br>asad ity ucyate pārtha<br>na ca tat pretya no iha</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Sacrifices, austerities and charities performed without faith in the Supreme Personality of Godhead are nonpermanent. Regardless of whatever rituals are performed, they are called <span class="Italic">asat,</span> nonpermanent. They are therefore useless both in this life and the next.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kings like Mahārāja Ambarīṣa and many other <span class="Italic">rājarṣis</span> who were pure devotees of the Lord simply passed their time in the service of the Supreme Lord. When a pure devotee executes some service through the agency of another person, he should not be criticized, for his activities are meant for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. A devotee may have a priest perform some <span class="Italic">karma-kāṇḍa,</span> and the priest may not be a pure Vaiṣṇava, but because the devotee wants to please the Supreme Lord, he should not be criticized. The word <span class="Italic">apūrva</span> is very significant. The resultant actions of <span class="Italic">karma</span> are called <span class="Italic">apūrva.</span> When we act piously or impiously, immediate results do not ensue. We therefore wait for the results, which are called <span class="Italic">apūrva.</span> The results are manifest in the future. Even the <span class="Italic">smārtas</span> accept this <span class="Italic">apūrva.</span> Pure devotees simply act for the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead; therefore the results of their activities are spiritual, or permanent. They are not like those of the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> which are nonpermanent. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.23):

            In this way, being purified by ritualistic sacrifices, the heart of Mahārāja Bharata was completely uncontaminated. His devotional service unto Vāsudeva, Lord Kṛṣṇa, increased day after day. Lord Kṛṣṇa, the son of Vasudeva, is the original Personality of Godhead manifest as the Supersoul [Paramātmā] as well as the impersonal Brahman. Yogīs meditate upon the localized Paramātmā situated in the heart, jñānīs worship the impersonal Brahman as the Supreme Absolute Truth, and devotees worship Vāsudeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose transcendental body is described in the śāstras. His body is decorated with the Śrīvatsa, the Kaustubha jewel and a flower garland, and His hands hold a conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower.

As stated in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> <span class="Ref_Italic">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ yo me bhaktyā prayacchati</span> (9.26). Worship of the Lord is not at all expensive. One can offer the Lord a leaf, a flower, a little fruit and some water. The Supreme Lord accepts these offerings when they are offered with love and devotion. In this way, one can become freed from material desires. As long as one maintains material desires, he cannot be happy. As soon as one engages in the devotional service of the Lord, his mind is purified of all material desires. Then one becomes fully satisfied.

            That most exalted devotee, Mahārāja Bharata, in this way engaged constantly in the devotional service of the Lord. Naturally his love for Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, increased more and more and melted his heart. Consequently he gradually lost all attachment for regulative duties. The hairs of his body stood on end, and all the ecstatic bodily symptoms were manifest. Tears flowed from his eyes, so much so that he could not see anything. Thus he constantly meditated on the reddish lotus feet of the Lord. At that time, his heart, which was like a lake, was filled with the water of ecstatic love. When his mind was immersed in that lake, he even forgot the regulative service to the Lord.

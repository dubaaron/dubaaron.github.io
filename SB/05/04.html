      <div class="summary">
        <div class="Normal-Level">In this chapter, Ṛṣabhadeva, the son of Mahārāja Nābhi, begot a hundred sons, and during the reign of those sons the world was very happy in all respects. When Ṛṣabhadeva appeared as the son of Mahārāja Nābhi, He was appreciated by the people as the most exalted and beautiful personality of that age. His poise, influence, strength, enthusiasm, bodily luster and other transcendental qualities were beyond compare. The word <span class="Italic">ṛṣabha</span> refers to the best, or the supreme. Due to the superexcellent attributes of the son of Mahārāja Nābhi, the King named his son Ṛṣabha, or “the best.” His influence was incomparable. Although there was a scarcity of rain, Ṛṣabhadeva did not care for Indra, the King of heaven, who is in charge of supplying rain. Through His own potency, Ṛṣabhadeva sumptuously covered Ajanābha with ample rain. Upon receiving Ṛṣabhadeva, who is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as his son, King Nābhi began to raise Him very carefully. After that, he entrusted the ruling power to Him and, retiring from family life, lived at Badarikāśrama completely engaged in the worship of Vāsudeva, the Supreme Lord. To follow social customs, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva for a while became a student in the <span class="Italic">gurukula,</span> and after returning. He followed the orders of His <span class="Italic">guru</span> and accepted a wife named Jayantī, who had been given to Him by the King of heaven, Indra. He begot a hundred sons in the womb of Jayantī. Of these hundred sons, the eldest was known as Bharata. Since the reign of Mahārāja Bharata, this planet has been called Bhārata-varṣa. Ṛṣabhadeva’s other sons were headed by Kuśāvarta, Ilāvarta, Brahmāvarta, Malaya, Ketu, Bhadrasena, Indraspṛk, Vidarbha and Kīkaṭa. There were also other sons named Kavi, Havi, Antarikṣa, Prabuddha, Pippalāyana, Avirhotra, Drumila, Camasa and Karabhājana. Instead of ruling the kingdom, these nine became mendicant preachers of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, following the religious precepts of the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam.</span> Their characteristics and activities are described in the Eleventh Canto of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> during the talks between Vasudeva and Nārada at Kurukṣetra. To teach the general populace, King Ṛṣabhadeva performed many sacrifices and taught His sons how to rule the citizens.</div>

            Śrī Śukadeva Gosvāmī said: As soon as the Lord was born as the son of Mahārāja Nābhi, He manifested symptoms of the Supreme Lord, such as marks on the bottoms of His feet [the flag, thunderbolt, etc.]. This son was equal to everyone and very peaceful. He could control His senses and His mind, and, possessing all opulence, He did not hanker for material enjoyment. Endowed with all these attributes, the son of Mahārāja Nābhi became more powerful day after day. Due to this, the citizens, learned brāhmaṇas, demigods and ministers wanted Ṛṣabhadeva to be appointed ruler of the earth.

            In these days of cheap incarnations, it is very interesting to note the bodily symptoms found in an incarnation. From the very beginning of His birth, it was observed that Ṛṣabhadeva’s feet were marked with the transcendental signs (a flag, thunderbolt, lotus flower, etc.). In addition to this, as the Lord began to grow, He became very prominent. He was equal to everyone. He did not favor one person and neglect another. An incarnation of God must have the six opulences—wealth. strength, knowledge, beauty, fame and renunciation. It is said that although Ṛṣabhadeva was endowed with all opulences, He was not at all attached to material enjoyment. He was self-controlled and therefore liked by everyone. Due to His superexcellent qualities, everyone wanted Him to rule the earth. An incarnation of God has to be accepted by experienced people and by the symptoms described in the <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> <span class="Italic">An</span> incarnation is not accepted simply by the adulation of foolish people.

            When the son of Mahārāja Nābhi became visible, He evinced all good qualities described by the great poets—namely, a well-built body with all the symptoms of the Godhead, prowess, strength, beauty, name, fame, influence and enthusiasm. When the father, Mahārāja Nābhi, saw all these qualities, he thought his son to be the best of human beings or the supreme being. Therefore he gave Him the name Ṛṣabha.

            To accept someone as God or an incarnation of God, one must observe the symptoms of God in his body. All the symptoms were found in the body of Mahārāja Nābhi’s extraordinarily powerful son. His body was well structured, and He displayed all the transcendental qualities. He showed great influence, and He could control His mind and senses. Consequently He was named Ṛṣabha, which indicates that He was the supreme living being.

            Indra, the King of heaven, who is very materially opulent, became envious of King Ṛṣabhadeva. Consequently he stopped pouring water on the planet known as Bhārata-varṣa. At that time the Supreme Lord, Ṛṣabhadeva, the master of all mystic power, understood King Indra’s purpose and smiled a little. Then, by His own prowess, through yogamāyā [His internal potency], He profusely poured water upon His own place, which was known as Ajanābha.

            We find the word <span class="Italic">bhagavān</span> used twice in this verse. Both King Indra and Ṛṣabhadeva, the incarnation of the Supreme Lord, are described as <span class="Italic">bhagavān.</span> Sometimes Nārada and Lord Brahmā are also addressed as <span class="Italic">bhagavān.</span> The word <span class="Italic">bhagavān</span> means that one is a very opulent and powerful person like Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Nārada or Indra. They are all addressed as <span class="Italic">bhagavān</span> due to their extraordinary opulence. King Ṛṣabhadeva is an incarnation of the Supreme Lord, and therefore He was the original Bhagavān. Consequently He is described herein as <span class="Italic">yogeśvara,</span> which indicates that He has the most powerful spiritual potency. He is not dependent on King Indra for water. He can supply water Himself, and He did so in this case. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> it is stated: <span class="Italic">yajñād bhavati parjanyaḥ [Bg. </span>3.14]<span class="Italic">.</span> Due to the performance of <span class="Italic">yajña,</span> clouds of water are manifest in the sky. Clouds and rainfall are under the management of Indra, the heavenly King, but when Indra is neglectful, the Supreme Lord Himself, who is also known as <span class="Italic">yajña</span> or <span class="Italic">yajña-pati,</span> takes the task upon Himself. Consequently there was sufficient rainfall in the place named Ajanābha. When <span class="Italic">yajña-pati</span> wants to, He can do anything without the help of any subordinate. Therefore the Supreme Lord is known as almighty. In the present age of Kali there will eventually be a great scarcity of water (<span class="Italic">anāvṛṣṭi</span>), for the general populace, due to ignorance and the scarcity of yajñic ingredients, will neglect to perform <span class="Italic">yajñas.</span> <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> therefore advises: <span class="Italic">yajñaiḥ saṅkīrtana-prāyaiḥ yajanti hi sumedhasaḥ.</span> After all, <span class="Italic">yajña</span> is meant to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this age of Kali. there is great scarcity and ignorance; nonetheless, everyone can perform <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña.</span> Every family in every society can conduct <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> at least every evening. In this way there will be no disturbance or scarcity of rain. It is essential for the people in this age to perform the <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> in order to be materially happy and to advance spiritually.

            Due to getting a perfect son according to his desire, King Nābhi was always overwhelmed with transcendental bliss and was very affectionate to his son. It was with ecstasy and a faltering voice that he addressed Him, “My dear son, my darling.” This mentality was brought about by yogamāyā, whereby he accepted the Supreme Lord, the supreme father, as his own son. Out of His supreme good will, the Lord became his son and dealt with everyone as if He were an ordinary human being. Thus King Nābhi began to raise his transcendental son with great affection, and he was overwhelmed with transcendental bliss, joy and devotion.

            The word <span class="Italic">māyā</span> is used in the sense of illusion. Considering the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be his own son, Mahārāja Nābhi was certainly in illusion, but this was transcendental illusion. This illusion is required; otherwise how can one accept the supreme father as his own son? The Supreme Lord appears as the son of one of His devotees, just as Lord Kṛṣṇa appeared as the son of Yaśodā and Nanda Mahārāja. These devotees could never think of their son as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, for such appreciation would hamper their relationship of paternal love.

            King Nābhi understood that his son, Ṛṣabhadeva, was very popular among the citizens and among government officers and ministers. Understanding the popularity of his son, Mahārāja Nābhi enthroned Him as the emperor of the world to give protection to the general populace in terms of the Vedic religious system. To do this, he entrusted Him into the hands of learned brāhmaṇas, who would guide Him in administrating the government. Then Mahārāja Nābhi and his wife, Merudevī, went to Badarikāśrama in the Himalaya Mountains, where the King engaged Himself very expertly in austerities and penances with great jubilation. In full samādhi he worshiped the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Nara-Nārāyaṇa, who is Kṛṣṇa in His plenary expansion. By doing so, in course of time Mahārāja Nābhi was elevated to the spiritual world known as Vaikuṇṭha.

            When Mahārāja Nābhi saw that his son Ṛṣabhadeva was popular with the general populace and the governmental servants, he chose to install Him on the imperial throne. In addition, he wanted to entrust his son into the hands of the learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas.</span> This means that a monarch was supposed to govern strictly according to Vedic principles under the guidance of learned <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇas,</span> who could advise Him according to the standard Vedic scriptures like <span class="Italic">Manu-smṛti</span> and similar <span class="Italic">śāstras.</span> It is the duty of the king to rule the citizens according to Vedic principles. According to Vedic principles, society is divided into four categories—<span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> <span class="Italic">Cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ [Bg. </span>4.13]<span class="Italic">.</span> After dividing society in this way, it is the king’s duty to see that everyone executes Vedic principles according to his caste. A <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> must perform the duty of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> without cheating the public. It is not that one attains the name of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> without the qualifications. It is the king’s duty to see that everyone engages in his occupational duty according to Vedic principles. In addition, retirement at the end of life is compulsory. Mahārāja Nābhi, although still a king. retired from family life and went with his wife to a place called Badarikāśrama in the Himalayas, where the Deity Nara-Nārāyaṇa is worshiped. The words <span class="Italic">prasanna-nipuṇena tapasā</span> indicate that the King accepted all kinds of austerity very expertly and jubilantly. He did not at all mind leaving his comfortable life at home, although he was the emperor. Despite undergoing severe austerities and penances, he felt very pleased at Badarikāśrama, and he did everything there expertly. In this way, being fully absorbed in Kṛṣṇa consciousness (<span class="Italic">samādhi-yoga</span>). always thinking of Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, Mahārāja Nābhi attained success at the end of his life and was promoted to the spiritual world, Vaikuṇṭhaloka.

            This is the way of Vedic life. One must stop the process of repeated birth and death and return home, back to Godhead. The words <span class="Italic">tan-mahimānam avāpa</span> are significant in this regard. Śrīla Śrīdhara Svāmī says that <span class="Italic">mahimā</span> means liberation in this life. We should act in such a way in this life that after giving up this body, we will become liberated from the bondage of repeated birth and death. This is called <span class="Italic">jīvan-mukti.</span> Śrīla Vīrarāghava Ācārya states that in the <span class="Italic">Chāndogya Upaniṣad</span> there are eight symptoms of a <span class="Italic">jīvan-mukta,</span> a person who is already liberated even when living in this body. The first symptom of one so liberated is that he is freed from all sinful activity (<span class="Italic">apahata-pāpa</span>). As long as one is under the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā</span> in the material energy, one has to engage in sinful activity. <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> describes such people as <span class="Italic">duṣkṛtinaḥ,</span> which indicates that they are always engaged in sinful activity. One who is liberated in this life does not commit any sinful activities. Sinful activity involves illicit sex, meat-eating, intoxication and gambling. Another symptom of a liberated person is <span class="Italic">vijara,</span> which indicates that he is not subjected to the miseries of old age. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">vimṛtyu.</span> A liberated person prepares himself in such a way that he does not take on any more material bodies, which are destined to die. In other words. he does not fall down again to repeat birth and death. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">viśoka,</span> which indicates that he is callous to material distress and happiness. Another is <span class="Italic">vijighatsa,</span> which indicates that he no longer desires material enjoyment. Another symptom is <span class="Italic">apipātā,</span> which means that he has no desire other than to engage in the devotional service of Kṛṣṇa, his dearmost pursuable Lord. A further symptom is <span class="Italic">satya-kāma,</span> which indicates that all his desires are directed to the Supreme Truth, Kṛṣṇa. He does not want anything else. He is <span class="Italic">satya-saṅkalpa.</span> Whatever he desires is fulfilled by the grace of Kṛṣṇa. First of all, he does not desire anything for his material benefit, and secondly if he desires anything at all, he simply desires to serve the Supreme Lord. That desire is fulfilled by the Lord’s grace. That is called <span class="Italic">satya-saṅkalpa.</span> Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī points out that the word <span class="Italic">mahimā</span> means returning to the spiritual world, back home, back to Vaikuṇṭha. Śrī Śukadeva says that the word <span class="Italic">mahimā</span> means that the devotee attains the qualities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is called <span class="Italic">sadharma,</span> or “the same quality.” Just as Kṛṣṇa is never born and never dies, His devotees who return to Godhead never die and never take birth within the material world.

            O Mahārāja Parīkṣit, to glorify Mahārāja Nābhi, the old sages composed two verses. One of them is this: “Who can attain the perfection of Mahārāja Nābhi? Who can attain his activities? Because of his devotional service, the Supreme Personality of Godhead agreed to become his son.”

            The words <span class="Italic">śuddhena karmaṇā</span> are significant in this verse. If work is not carried out in devotional service, it is contaminated by the modes of material nature. That is explained in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā:</span> <span class="Italic">yajñārthāt karmaṇo ’nyatra loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ [Bg. 3.9]</span>)<span class="Italic">.</span> Activities performed only for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord are pure and are not contaminated by the modes of material nature. All other activities are contaminated by the modes of ignorance and passion, as well as goodness. All material activities meant for satisfying the senses are contaminated, and Mahārāja Nābhi did not perform anything contaminated. He simply executed his transcendental activities even when performing <span class="Italic">yajña.</span> Consequently he obtained the Supreme Lord as his son.

            After Nābhi Mahārāja departed for Badarikāśrama, the Supreme Lord, Ṛṣabhadeva, understood that His kingdom was His field of activities. He therefore showed Himself as an example and taught the duties of a householder by first accepting brahmacarya under the direction of spiritual masters. He also went to live at the spiritual masters’ place, gurukula. After His education was finished, He gave gifts (guru-dakṣiṇā) to His spiritual masters and then accepted the life of a householder. He took a wife named Jayantī and begot one hundred sons who were as powerful and qualified as He Himself. His wife Jayantī had been offered to Him by Indra, the King of heaven. Ṛṣabhadeva and Jayantī performed householder life in an exemplary way, carrying out ritualistic activities ordained by the śruti and smṛti śāstra.

            Being an incarnation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva was fully independent because His form was spiritual, eternal and full of transcendental bliss. He eternally had nothing to do with the four principles of material misery [birth, death, old age and disease]. Nor was He materially attached. He was always equipoised, and He saw everyone on the same level. He was unhappy to see others unhappy, and He was the well-wisher of all living entities. Although He was a perfect personality, the Supreme Lord and controller of all, He nonetheless acted as if He were an ordinary conditioned soul. Therefore He strictly followed the principles of varṇāśrama-dharma and acted accordingly. In due course of time, the principles of varṇāśrama-dharma had become neglected; therefore through His personal characteristics and behavior, He taught the ignorant public how to perform duties within the varṇāśrama-dharma. In this way He regulated the general populace in householder life, enabling them to develop religion and economic well-being and to attain reputations, sons and daughters, material pleasure and finally eternal life. By His instructions, He showed how people could remain householders and at the same time become perfect by following the principles of varṇāśrama-dharma.

In this way, everyone can be elevated to the highest transcendental position and be freed from material attachment. The material world is described by Lord Kṛṣṇa Himself as <span class="Italic">duḥkhālayam aśāśvatam [Bg. </span>8.15]<span class="Italic">,</span> a temporary place of misery. No one can stay here, even if he makes a compromise with misery. One has to give up this body and accept another, which may not even be a human body.

A Vaiṣṇava does not disrespect the demigods, but on the other hand he is not so foolish that he accepts each and every demigod as the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is master of all demigods; therefore the demigods are His servants. The Vaiṣṇava accepts them as servants of the Supreme Lord, and he worships them directly. In the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā,</span> the important demigods—Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā and even the incarnations and expansions of Lord Kṛṣṇa like Mahā-Viṣṇu, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu and all the other <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattvas,</span> as well as the <span class="Italic">śakti-tattvas</span> like Durgādevī—are all worshiped by the process of worshiping Govinda with the words <span class="Italic">govindam ādi-puruṣaṁ tam ahaṁ bhajāmi **.</span> A Vaiṣṇava worships the demigods in relation to Govinda, not independently.

            No one likes to possess anything that is like a will-o’-the-wisp or a flower in the sky, for everyone knows very well that such things do not exist. When Lord Ṛṣabhadeva ruled this planet of Bhāratavarṣa, even common men did not want to ask for anything, at any time or by any means. No one ever asks for a will-o’-the-wisp. In other words, everyone was completely satisfied, and therefore there was no chance of anyone’s asking for anything. The people were absorbed in great affection for the King. Since this affection was always expanding, they were not inclined to ask for anything.

            In Bengal the word <span class="Italic">ghoḍā-ḍimba</span> is used, which means “the egg of a horse.” Since a horse never lays an egg, the word <span class="Italic">ghoḍā-ḍimba</span> actually has no meaning. In Sanskrit there is a word <span class="Italic">kha-puṣpa,</span> which means “the flower in the sky.” No flower grows in the sky; therefore no one is interested in asking for <span class="Italic">kha-puṣpa</span> or <span class="Italic">ghoḍā-ḍimba.</span> During the reign of Mahārāja Ṛṣabhadeva, people were so well equipped that they did not want to ask for anything. They were immensely supplied with all necessities for life due to King Ṛṣabhadeva’s good government. Consequently everyone felt full satisfaction and did not want anything. This is the perfection of government. If the citizens are unhappy due to bad government, the heads of government are condemned. During these democratic days, monarchy is disliked by the people, but here is an example of how an emperor of the whole world kept all the citizens fully satisfied by supplying the necessities of life and following the Vedic principles. Thus everyone was happy during the reign of Mahārāja Ṛṣabhadeva, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            Once while touring the world, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva, the Supreme Lord, reached a place known as Brahmāvarta. There was a great conference of learned brāhmaṇas at that place, and all the King’s sons attentively heard the instructions of the brāhmaṇas there. At that assembly, within the hearing of the citizens, Ṛṣabhadeva instructed His sons, although they were already very well behaved, devoted and qualified. He instructed them so that in the future they could rule the world very perfectly. Thus he spoke as follows.

            The instructions of Lord Ṛṣabhadeva to His sons are very valuable if one wants to live peacefully within this world, which is full of miseries. In the next chapter, Lord Ṛṣabhadeva gives His sons these valuable instructions.

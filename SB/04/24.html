            The great sage Maitreya continued: Vijitāśva, the eldest son of Mahārāja Pṛthu, who had a reputation like his father’s, became emperor and gave his younger brothers different directions of the world to govern, for he was very affectionate toward his brothers.

            After describing the life and character of Mahārāja Pṛthu in the previous chapter, the great sage Maitreya began to speak about the sons and grandsons in the genealogical line of the Pṛthu dynasty. After the death of Mahārāja Pṛthu, his eldest son, Vijitāśva, became emperor of the world. King Vijitāśva was very affectionate toward his younger brothers, and therefore he wanted them to rule different directions of the world. From time immemorial the eldest son generally becomes king after the death of the previous king. When the Pāṇḍavas ruled the earth, Mahārāja Yudhiṣṭhira, the eldest son of King Pāṇḍu, became emperor, and his younger brothers assisted him. Similarly, King Vijitāśva’s younger brothers were appointed to govern the different directions of the world.

            Formerly, Mahārāja Vijitāśva pleased the King of heaven, Indra, and from him received the title Antardhāna. His wife’s name was Śikhaṇḍinī, and by her he begot three good sons.

            Mahārāja Vijitāśva was known as Antardhāna, which means “disappearance.” He received this title from Indra, and it refers to the time when Indra stole Mahārāja Pṛthu’s horse from the sacrificial arena. Indra was not visible to others when he was stealing the horse, but Mahārāja Pṛthu’s son Vijitāśva could see him. Yet despite his knowing that Indra was taking away his father’s horse, Vijitāśva did not attack him. This indicates that Mahārāja Vijitāśva respected the right persons. Although Indra was stealing the horse from his father, Vijitāśva knew perfectly well that Indra was not an ordinary thief. Since Indra was a great and powerful demigod and servant of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vijitāśva purposefully excused him due to sentiment only, even though Indra was acting wrongly. Thus Indra became very pleased with Vijitāśva at that time. The demigods have the great mystic power of being able to appear and disappear according to their will, and since Indra was very pleased with Vijitāśva, he bestowed this mystic power upon him. Thus Vijitāśva became known as Antardhāna.

            The three sons of Mahārāja Antardhāna were named Pāvaka, Pavamāna and Śuci. Formerly these three personalities were the demigods of fire, but due to the curse of the great sage Vasiṣṭha, they became the sons of Mahārāja Antardhāna. As such, they were as powerful as the fire-gods, and they attained the destination of mystic yoga power, being again situated as the demigods of fire.

            In the <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (6.41–43) it is stated that one who falls down from <span class="Italic">yoga</span> practice is elevated to the heavenly planets, and after enjoying the material facilities there he again comes down to the earthly planet and takes birth in a very rich family or a very pious <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> family. Thus it is to be understood that when demigods fall down, they come to earth as sons of very rich and pious families. In such families, the living entity gets an opportunity to execute Kṛṣṇa consciousness and thereby gain promotion to his desired goal. The sons of Mahārāja Antardhāna had been the demigods in charge of fire, and they regained their former position and by mystic power returned to the heavenly planets.

            Mahārāja Antardhāna had another wife, named Nabhasvatī, and by her he was happy to beget another son, named Havirdhāna. Since Mahārāja Antardhāna was very liberal, he did not kill Indra while the demigod was stealing his father’s horse at the sacrifice.
          </p>

        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_5_purport">

            It is understood from various scriptures and <span class="Italic">purāṇas</span> that the King of heaven, Indra, was very expert in stealing and kidnapping. He could steal anything without being visible to the proprietor, and he could kidnap anyone’s wife without being detected. Once he raped the wife of Gautama Muni by using his disappearing art, and similarly by becoming invisible he stole the horse of Mahārāja Pṛthu. Although in human society such activities are considered abominable, the demigod Indra was not considered to be degraded by them. Although Antardhāna could understand that King Indra was stealing the horse from his father, he did not kill Indra, for he knew that if one who is very powerful sometimes commits an abominable act, it should be disregarded. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.30) it is clearly stated:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">api cet su-durācāro<br>bhajate mām ananya-bhāk<br>sādhur eva sa mantavyaḥ<br>samyag vyavasito hi saḥ</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus the Lord says that even if a devotee commits an abominable act, he should be considered a <span class="Italic">sādhu,</span> or a pious man, because of his unflinching devotion to the Lord. The devotees of the Lord never willingly commit any sinful act, but sometimes they commit something abominable due to their previous habits. Such acts should not be taken very seriously, however, because the devotees of the Lord are very powerful, whether they are on the heavenly planets or on this planet. If by chance they commit something abominable, it should not be taken into account, but should be overlooked.

            Whenever Antardhāna, the supreme royal power, had to exact taxes, punish his citizens or fine them severely, he was not willing to do so. Consequently he retired from the execution of such duties and engaged himself in the performance of different sacrifices.

        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_6_purport">

            It is clear herein that the king sometimes has to perform duties which are not very desirable just because he is the king. Similarly, Arjuna was not at all willing to fight because fighting or killing one’s own kinsmen and family members is not at all desirable. Nonetheless the <span class="Italic">kṣatriyas</span> had to perform such undesirable actions as a matter of duty. Mahārāja Antardhāna was not very happy while exacting taxes or punishing the citizens for their criminal activities; therefore, on the plea of performing sacrifices, he retired from the royal majestic power at a very early age.

            Although Mahārāja Antardhāna was engaged in performing sacrifices, because he was a self-realized soul he very intelligently rendered devotional service to the Lord, who eradicates all the fears of His devotees. By thus worshiping the Supreme Lord, Mahārāja Antardhāna, rapt in ecstasy, attained His planet very easily.

In other words, he was performing the usual sacrifices by the method of <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña,</span> as recommended herein:

            As stated in the previous verse (<span class="Italic">kriyā-kāṇḍeṣu niṣṇātaḥ</span>), Mahārāja Barhiṣat dived very deeply into the fruitive activities of sacrifice. This means that as soon as he finished one <span class="Italic">yajña</span> in one place, he began performing another <span class="Italic">yajña</span> in the immediate vicinity. At the present moment there is a similar need to perform <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> all over the world. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement has started performing <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> in different places, and it has been experienced that wherever <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> is performed, many thousands of people gather and take part in it. Imperceptible auspiciousness achieved in this connection should be continued all over the world. The members of the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement should perform <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajñas</span> one after another, so much that all the people of the world will either jokingly or seriously chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, and thus they will derive the benefit of cleansing the heart. The holy name of the Lord (<span class="Italic">harer nāma</span> [Adi 17.21]) is so powerful that whether it is chanted jokingly or seriously the effect of vibrating this transcendental sound will be equally distributed. It is not possible at the present moment to perform repeated <span class="Italic">yajñas</span> as Mahārāja Barhiṣat performed, but it is within our means to perform <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña,</span> which does not cost anything. One can sit down anywhere and chant Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. If the surface of the globe is overflooded with the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> the people of the world will be very, very happy.

            Mahārāja Barhiṣat—henceforward known as Prācīnabarhi—was ordered by the supreme demigod Lord Brahmā to marry the daughter of the ocean named Śatadruti. Her bodily features were completely beautiful, and she was very young. She was decorated with the proper garments, and when she came into the marriage arena and began circumambulating it, the fire-god Agni became so attracted to her that he desired her company, exactly as he had formerly desired to enjoy Śukī.

            In this verse the word <span class="Italic">suṣṭhv-alaṅkṛtām</span> is significant. According to the Vedic system, when a girl is married, she is very profusely and gorgeously decorated with costly saris and jewelry, and during the marriage ceremony the bride circumambulates the bridegroom seven times. After this, the bridegroom and bride look at one another and become attracted for life. When the bridegroom finds the bride very beautiful, the attraction between them immediately becomes very strongly fixed. As stated in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> men and women are naturally attracted to one another, and when they are united by marriage that attraction becomes very strong. Being so strongly attracted, the bridegroom attempts to set up a nice homestead and eventually a good field for producing grains. Then children come, then friends and then wealth. In this way the male becomes more and more entangled in the material conceptions of life, and he begins to think, “This is mine,” and”it is I who am acting.” In this way the illusion of material existence is perpetuated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The words <span class="Italic">śukīm iva</span> are also significant, for the fire-god Agni became attracted by the beauty of Śatadruti while she was circumambulating the bridegroom Prācīnabarhi, just as he had previously been attracted to the beauty of Śukī, the wife of Saptarṣi. When the fire-god had been present long ago at the assembly of Saptarṣi, he was attracted by the beauty of Śukī when she was circumambulating in the same way. Agni’s wife, named Svāhā, took the form of Śukī and enjoyed sex life with Agni. Not only the fire-god Agni but the heavenly god Indra and sometimes even Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva—all very highly situated demigods—are subject to being attracted by sex at any time. The sex drive is so strong in the living entities that the whole material world is running on sex attraction only, and it is due to sex attraction that one remains in the material world and is obliged to accept different types of bodies. The attraction of sex life is more clearly explained in the next verse.

            While Śatadruti was thus being married, the demons, the denizens of Gandharvaloka, the great sages, and the denizens of Siddhaloka, the earthly planets and Nāgaloka, although highly exalted, were all captivated by the tinkling of her ankle bells.

            Generally a woman becomes more beautiful when, after an early marriage, she gives birth to a child. To give birth to a child is the natural function of a woman, and therefore a woman becomes more and more beautiful as she gives birth to one child after another. In the case of Śatadruti, however, she was so beautiful that she attracted the whole universe at her marriage ceremony. Indeed, she attracted all the learned and exalted demigods simply by the tinkling of her ankle bells. This indicates that all the demigods wanted to see her beauty completely, but they were not able to see it because she was fully dressed and covered with ornaments. Since they could only see the feet of Śatadruti, they became attracted by her ankle bells, which tinkled as she walked. In other words, the demigods became captivated by her simply by hearing the tinkling of her ankle bells. They did not have to see her complete beauty. It is sometimes understood that a person becomes lusty just by hearing the tinkling of bangles on the hands of women or the tinkling of ankle bells, or just by seeing a woman’s sari. Thus it is concluded that woman is the complete representation of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span> Although Viśvāmitra Muni was engaged in practicing mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> with closed eyes, his transcendental meditation was broken when he heard the tinkling of bangles on the hands of Menakā. In this way Viśvāmitra Muni became a victim of Menakā and fathered a child who is universally celebrated as Śakuntalā. The conclusion is that no one can save himself from the attraction of woman, even though he be an exalted demigod or an inhabitant of the higher planets. Only a devotee of the Lord, who is attracted by Kṛṣṇa, can escape the lures of woman. Once one is attracted by Kṛṣṇa, the illusory energy of the world cannot attract him.

            When all these Pracetās were ordered by their father to marry and beget children, they all entered the ocean and practiced austerities and penances for ten thousand years. Thus they worshiped the master of all austerity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            Sometimes great sages and ascetics enter the Himalaya Mountains in order to find seclusion from the turmoil of the world. It appears, however, that all the Pracetās, the sons of Prācīnabarhi, entered the depths of the ocean to perform austerity in a secluded place. Since they performed austerities for ten thousand years, this incident took place in the Satya-yuga, when people used to live for a hundred thousand years. It is also significant that by their austerity they worshiped the master of austerity, Śrī Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one wants to perform austerities and penances in order to attain the supreme goal, one must attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If one achieves the favor of the Supreme Lord, it is to be understood that he has finished all kinds of austerities and penances and has attained efficiency in their execution. On the other hand, if one does not attain the perfect stage of devotional service, all austerities and penances actually have no meaning, for without the Supreme Lord no one can attain the highest results derived from performing them. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (5.29), Lord Śrī Kṛṣṇa is the master of all penances and sacrifices. <span class="Italic">Bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram.</span> Thus the desired result of performing austerities may be derived from Lord Kṛṣṇa.

By the grace of Lord Caitanya, one who chants the <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> (Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare) attains the highest perfectional stage, which had previously been attained by people who entered the ocean and executed austerities for ten thousand years. In this age of Kali, if a person does not take advantage of chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> which is offered as a great concession to the fallen human beings of this age, it is to be understood that he is very much bewildered by the illusory energy of the Lord.

            When all the sons of Prācīnabarhi left home to execute austerities, they met Lord Śiva, who, out of great mercy, instructed them about the Absolute Truth. All the sons of Prācīnabarhi meditated upon the instructions, chanting and worshiping them with great care and attention.

            It is clear that to perform austerities or penances, or, for that matter, any form of devotional service, one has to be guided by a spiritual master. Here it is clearly stated that the ten sons of Mahārāja Prācīnabarhi were favored by the appearance of Lord Śiva, who, out of great kindness, gave them instructions regarding the execution of austerities. Lord Śiva actually became the spiritual master of the ten sons, and in turn his disciples took his words so seriously that simply by meditating upon his instructions (<span class="Italic">dhyāyantaḥ</span>) they became perfect. This is the secret of success. After being initiated and receiving the orders of the spiritual master, the disciple should unhesitatingly think about the instructions or orders of the spiritual master and should not allow himself to be disturbed by anything else. This is also the verdict of Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, who, while explaining a verse of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (<span class="Italic">vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana,</span> Bg. 2.41), points out that the order of the spiritual master is the life substance of the disciple. The disciple should not consider whether he is going back home, back to Godhead; his first business should be to execute the order of his spiritual master. Thus a disciple should always meditate on the order of the spiritual master, and that is perfectional meditation. Not only should he meditate upon that order, but he should find out the means by which he can perfectly worship and execute it.

            Since Lord Śiva does not incarnate himself unless there is some special reason, it is very difficult for an ordinary person to contact him. However, Lord Śiva does descend on a special occasion when he is ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In this regard, it is stated in the <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa</span> that Lord Śiva appeared as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> in the age of Kali to preach the Māyāvāda philosophy, which is nothing but a type of Buddhist philosophy. It is stated in <span class="Italic">Padma Purāṇa:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            Lord Śiva, speaking to Pārvatī-devī, foretold that he would spread the Māyāvāda philosophy in the guise of a <span class="Italic">sannyāsī brāhmaṇa</span> just to eradicate Buddhist philosophy. This <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> was Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya. In order to overcome the effects of Buddhist philosophy and spread Vedānta philosophy, Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya had to make some compromise with the Buddhist philosophy, and as such he preached the philosophy of monism, for it was required at that time. Otherwise there was no need for his preaching Māyāvāda philosophy. At the present moment there is no need for Māyāvāda philosophy or Buddhist philosophy, and Lord Caitanya rejected both of them. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is spreading the philosophy of Lord Caitanya and rejecting the philosophy of both classes of Māyāvādī. Strictly speaking, both Buddhist philosophy and Śaṅkara’s philosophy are but different types of Māyāvāda dealing on the platform of material existence. Neither of these philosophies has spiritual significance. There is spiritual significance only after one accepts the philosophy of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> which culminates in surrendering unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Generally people worship Lord Śiva for some material benefit, and although they cannot see him personally, they derive great material profit by worshiping him.

            These are twelve great authorities in preaching God consciousness. The name Śambhu means Lord Śiva. His disciplic succession is also known as the Viṣṇusvāmi-sampradāya, and the current Viṣṇusvāmi-sampradāya is also known as the Vallabha-sampradāya. The current Brahma-sampradāya is known as the Madhva-Gauḍīya-sampradāya. Even though Lord Śiva appeared to preach Māyāvāda philosophy, at the end of his pastime in the form of Śaṅkarācārya, he preached the Vaiṣṇava philosophy: <span class="Italic">bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ bhaja govindaṁ mūḍha-mate.</span> He stressed worshiping Lord Kṛṣṇa, or Govinda, three times in this verse and especially warned his followers that they could not possibly achieve deliverance, or <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> simply by word jugglery and grammatical puzzles. If one is actually serious to attain <span class="Italic">mukti,</span> he must worship Lord Kṛṣṇa. That is Śrīpāda Śaṅkarācārya’s last instruction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Herein it is mentioned that Lord Śiva is always accompanied by his material energy (<span class="Italic">śaktyā ghorayā</span>). Material energy—goddess Durgā, or goddess Kālī—is always under his control. Goddess Kālī and Durgā serve him by killing all the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> or demons. Sometimes Kālī becomes so infuriated that she indiscriminately kills all kinds of <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> There is a popular picture of goddess Kālī in which she wears a garland composed of the heads of the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> and holds in her left hand a captured head and in her right hand a great <span class="Italic">khaḍga,</span> or chopper, for killing <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> Great wars are symbolic representations of Kālī’s devastation of the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> and are actually conducted by the goddess Kālī.

            (<span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> 5.44)
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="Italic">Asuras</span> try to pacify the goddess Kālī, or Durgā, by worshiping her in material opulence, but when the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> become too intolerable, goddess Kālī does not discriminate in killing them wholesale. <span class="Italic">Asuras</span> do not know the secret of the energy of Lord Śiva, and they prefer to worship goddess Kālī or Durgā or Lord Śiva for material benefit. Due to their demoniac character, they are reluctant to surrender to Lord Kṛṣṇa, as indicated by <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.15):

          <p>

          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Śiva’s duty is very dangerous because he has to employ the energy of goddess Kālī (or Durgā). In another popular picture the goddess Kālī is sometimes seen standing on the prostrate body of Lord Śiva, which indicates that sometimes Lord Śiva has to fall down flat in order to stop goddess Kālī from killing the <span class="Italic">asuras.</span> Since Lord Śiva controls the great material energy (goddess Durgā), worshipers of Lord Śiva attain very opulent positions within this material world. Under Lord Śiva’s direction, a worshiper of Lord Śiva gets all kinds of material facilities. In contrast, a Vaiṣṇava, or worshiper of Lord Viṣṇu, gradually becomes poorer in material possessions because Lord Viṣṇu does not trick His devotees into becoming materially entangled by possessions. Lord Viṣṇu gives His devotees intelligence from within, as stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.10):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">teṣāṁ satata-yuktānāṁ<br>bhajatāṁ prīti-pūrvakam<br>dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ<br>yena mām upayānti te</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “To those who are constantly devoted and worship Me with love, I give the understanding by which they can come to Me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus Lord Viṣṇu gives intelligence to His devotee so that the devotee can make progress on the path back home, back to Godhead. Since a devotee has nothing to do with any kind of material possession, he does not come under the control of goddess Kālī, or the goddess Durgā.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Śiva is also in charge of the <span class="Italic">tamo-guṇa,</span> or the mode of ignorance in this material world. His potency, the goddess Durgā, is described as keeping all living entities in the darkness of ignorance (<span class="Italic">yā devī sarva-bhūteṣu nidra-rūpaṁ saṁsthitā</span>). Both Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva are incarnations of Lord Viṣṇu, but Lord Brahmā is in charge of the creation whereas Lord Śiva is in charge of the destruction, which he carries out with the help of his material energy, goddess Kālī, or goddess Durgā. Thus in this verse Lord Śiva is described as being accompanied by dangerous potencies (<span class="Italic">śaktyā ghorayā</span>), and that is the actual position of Lord Śiva.

            The great sage Maitreya continued: My dear Vidura, because of their pious nature, all the sons of Prācīnabarhi very seriously accepted the words of their father with heart and soul, and with these words on their heads, they went toward the west to execute their father’s order.

            In this verse <span class="Italic">sādhavaḥ</span> (meaning “pious” or “well behaved”) is very important, especially at the present moment. It is derived from the word <span class="Italic">sādhu.</span> A perfect <span class="Italic">sādhu</span> is one who is always engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Prācīnabarhi’s sons are described as <span class="Italic">sādhavaḥ</span> because of their complete obedience to their father. The father, king and spiritual master are supposed to be representatives of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as such they have to be respected as the Supreme Lord. It is the duty of the father, the spiritual master and the king to regulate their subordinates in such a way that they ultimately become fully unalloyed devotees of the Supreme Lord. That is the duty of the superiors, and it is the duty of the subordinates to obey their orders perfectly and in a disciplined way. The word <span class="Italic">śirasā</span> (“on their heads”) is also significant, for the Pracetās accepted the orders of their father and carried them on their heads, which means they accepted them in complete surrender.

            While traveling, the Pracetās happened to see a great reservoir of water which seemed almost as big as the ocean. The water of this lake was so calm and quiet that it seemed like the mind of a great soul, and its inhabitants, the aquatics, appeared very peaceful and happy to be under the protection of such a watery reservoir.
          </p>
        </div>

            The word <span class="Italic">sa-samudra</span> means “near the sea.” The reservoir of water was like a bay, for it was not very far from the sea. The word <span class="Italic">upa,</span> meaning “more or less,” is used in many ways, as in the word <span class="Italic">upapati,</span> which indicates a husband “more or less,” that is to say, a lover who is acting like a husband. <span class="Italic">Upa</span> also means “greater,” “smaller” or “nearer.” Considering all these points, the reservoir of water which was seen by the Pracetās while they were traveling was actually a large bay or lake. And unlike the sea or ocean, which has turbulent waves, this reservoir was very calm and quiet. Indeed, the water was so clear that it seemed like the mind of some great soul. There may be many great souls—<span class="Italic">jñānīs, yogīs</span> and <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> or pure devotees, are also called great souls—but they are very rarely found. One can find many great souls amongst <span class="Italic">yogīs</span> and <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> but a truly great soul, a pure devotee of the Lord, who is fully surrendered to the Lord, is very rarely found (<span class="Italic">sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ,</span> Bg. 7.19). A devotee’s mind is always calm, quiet and desireless because he is always <span class="Italic">anyābhilāṣitā-śūnyam</span> [Madhya 19.167]<span class="Italic">,</span> having no desire other than to serve Kṛṣṇa as His personal servant, friend, father, mother or conjugal lover. Due to his association with Kṛṣṇa, a devotee is always very calm and cool. It is also significant that within that reservoir all the aquatics were also very calm and quiet. Because the disciples of a devotee have taken shelter of a great soul, they become very calm and quiet and are not agitated by the waves of the material world.
          </p>
          <p>
            This material world is often described as an ocean of nescience. In such an ocean, everything is agitated. The mind of a great devotee is also like an ocean or a very large lake, but there is no agitation. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (2.41): <span class="Italic">vyavasāyātmikā buddhir ekeha kuru-nandana.</span> Those who are fixed in the service of the Lord are not agitated by anything. It is also stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (6.22): <span class="Italic">yasmin sthito na duḥkhena guruṇāpi vicālyate.</span> Even if he suffers some reversals in life, a devotee is never agitated. Therefore whoever takes shelter of a great soul or a great devotee becomes pacified. In the <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Madhya</span> 19.149) it is stated: <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-bhakta—niṣkāma, ataeva ‘śānta.</span>’ A devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is always peaceful because he has no desire, whereas the <span class="Italic">yogīs, karmīs</span> and <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> have so many desires to fulfill. One may argue that the devotees have desires, for they wish to go home, back to Godhead, but such a desire does not agitate the mind. Although he wishes to go back to Godhead, a devotee is satisfied in any condition of life. Consequently, the word <span class="Italic">mahan-manaḥ</span> is used in this verse to indicate that the reservoir of water was as calm and quiet as the mind of a great devotee.

            In that great lake there were different types of lotus flowers. Some of them were bluish, and some of them were red. Some of them grew at night, some in the day and some, like the indīvara lotus flower, in the evening. Combined together, the lotus flowers filled the lake so full that the lake appeared to be a great mine of such flowers. Consequently, on the shores there were swans and cranes, cakravāka, kāraṇḍava and other beautiful water birds standing about.

            The word <span class="Italic">ākaram</span> (“mine”) is significant in this verse, for the reservoir of water appeared like a mine from which different types of lotus flowers were produced. Some of the lotus flowers grew during the day, some at night and some in the evening, and accordingly they had different names and different colors. All these flowers were present on that lake, and because the lake was so calm and quiet and filled with lotus flowers, superior birds, like swans, <span class="Italic">cakravākas</span> and <span class="Italic">kāraṇḍavas,</span> stood on the shores and vibrated their different songs, making the entire scene attractive and beautiful. As there are different types of human beings, according to the association of the three qualities of material nature, there are similarly different types of birds, bees, trees, etc. Everything is divided according to the three qualities of material nature. Birds like swans and cranes, who enjoy clear waters and lotus flowers, are different from crows, who enjoy filthy places. Similarly, there are persons who are controlled by the modes of ignorance and passion and those who are controlled by the mode of goodness. The creation is so varied that there are always varieties found in every society. Thus on the bank of this lake all the superior birds lived to enjoy that atmosphere created by that great reservoir filled with lotus flowers.

            There were various trees and creepers on all sides of the lake, and there were mad bumblebees humming all about them. The trees appeared to be very jolly due to the sweet humming of the bumblebees, and the saffron, which was contained in the lotus flowers, was being thrown into the air. These all created such an atmosphere that it appeared as though a festival were taking place there.

            Trees and creepers are also different types of living beings. When bumblebees come upon trees and creepers to collect honey, certainly such plants become very happy. On such an occasion the wind also takes advantage of the situation by throwing pollen or saffron contained in the lotus flowers. All this combines with the sweet vibration created by the swans and the calm of the water. The Pracetās considered such a place to be like a continuous festival. From this description it appears that the Pracetās reached Śivaloka, which is supposed to be situated near the Himalaya Mountains.

            In addition to the various flowers and living entities about the lake, there were also many musical vibrations.

Actually one has to attain the perfection of <span class="Italic">sac-cid-ānanda,</span> eternity, bliss and knowledge. Because the impersonalists deny these varieties of creation, they cannot actually enjoy transcendental bliss. The place where the Pracetās arrived was the abode of Lord Śiva. Impersonalists are generally worshipers of Lord Śiva, but Lord Śiva is never without variety in his abode. Thus wherever one goes, whether to the planet of Lord Śiva, Lord Viṣṇu or Lord Brahmā, there is variety to be enjoyed by persons full in knowledge and bliss.

            The Pracetās were fortunate to see Lord Śiva, the chief of the demigods, emerging from the water with his associates. His bodily luster was just like molten gold, his throat was bluish, and he had three eyes, which looked very mercifully upon his devotees. He was accompanied by many musicians, who were glorifying him. As soon as the Pracetās saw Lord Śiva, they immediately offered their obeisances in great amazement and fell down at the lotus feet of the lord.

            The word <span class="Italic">vibudhānugaiḥ</span> indicates that Lord Śiva is always accompanied by the denizens of the higher planets known as Gandharvas and Kinnaras. They are very expert in musical science, and Lord Śiva is worshiped by them constantly. In pictures, Lord Śiva is generally painted white, but here we find that the color of his skin is not exactly white but like molten gold, or a glowing yellowish color. Because Lord Śiva is always very, very merciful, his name is Āśutoṣa. Amongst all the demigods, Lord Śiva can be pacified even by the lowest class of men, who need only offer him obeisances and leaves of a bael tree. Thus his name is Āśutoṣa, which means that he is pleased very quickly.

            Generally those who are very fond of material prosperity approach Lord Śiva for such benediction. The lord, being very merciful, quickly awards all the blessings the devotee asks of him. The demons take advantage of this leniency and sometimes take benedictions from Lord Śiva which can be very dangerous to others. For instance, Vṛkāsura took a benediction from Lord Śiva by which he could kill everyone he touched on the head. Although Lord Śiva sometimes very liberally gives such benedictions to his devotees, the difficulty is that the demons, being very cunning, sometimes want to experiment improperly with such benedictions. For instance, after receiving his benediction, Vṛkāsura tried to touch the head of Lord Śiva. Devotees of Lord Viṣṇu, however, have no desire for such benedictions, and Lord Viṣṇu does not give His devotees benedictions which would cause disturbance to the whole world.

            Lord Śiva became very pleased with the Pracetās because generally Lord Śiva is the protector of pious persons and persons of gentle behavior. Being very much pleased with the princes, he began to speak as follows.

            The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, or Kṛṣṇa, is known as <span class="Italic">bhakta-vatsala,</span> and herein we find Lord Śiva described as <span class="Italic">dharma-vatsala.</span> Of course, the word <span class="Italic">dharma-vatsala</span> refers to a person who lives according to religious principles. That is understood. Nonetheless, these two words have additional significance. Sometimes Lord Śiva has to deal with persons who are in the modes of passion and ignorance. Such persons are not always very much religious and pious in their activities, but since they worship Lord Śiva for some material profit, they sometimes obey the religious principles. As soon as Lord Śiva sees that his devotees are following religious principles, he blesses them. The Pracetās, sons of Prācīnabarhi, were naturally very pious and gentle, and consequently Lord Śiva was immediately pleased with them. Lord Śiva could understand that the princes were sons of Vaiṣṇavas, and as such Lord Śiva offered prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead as follows.

            Lord Śiva said: You are all the sons of King Prācīnabarhi, and I wish all good fortune to you. I also know what you are going to do, and therefore I am visible to you just to show my mercy upon you.

            By these words Lord Śiva indicates that what the princes were going to do was known to him. It is a fact that they were going to worship Lord Viṣṇu by severe austerities and penances. Knowing this fact, Lord Śiva immediately became very pleased, as apparent by the next verse. This indicates that a person who is not yet a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead but who desires to serve the Supreme Lord receives the benedictions of the demigods, headed by the chief demigod, Lord Śiva. Thus a devotee of the Lord does not need to try to please the demigods separately. Simply by worshiping the Supreme Lord, a devotee can please all of them. Nor does he have to ask the demigods for material benedictions, for the demigods, being pleased with the devotee, automatically offer him everything that he needs. The demigods are servants of the Lord, and they are always prepared to help a devotee in all circumstances. Therefore Śrīla Bilvamaṅgala Ṭhākura said that if one has unalloyed devotion for the Supreme Lord, the goddess of liberation is ready to serve him, to say nothing of the gods of material opulences. Indeed, all the demigods are simply waiting for an opportunity to serve the devotee. Thus there is no need for a devotee of Kṛṣṇa to endeavor for material opulence or liberation. By being situated in the transcendental position of devotional service, he receives all the benefits of <span class="Italic">dharma, artha, kāma</span> and <span class="Italic">mokṣa.</span>

            Now Lord Śiva explains the reason he has personally come before the princes. It is because all the princes are devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.19):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante<br>jñānavān māṁ prapadyate<br>vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti<br>sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ</div>

            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Śiva is rarely seen by common men, and similarly a person who is fully surrendered unto Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is also very rarely seen because a person who is fully surrendered unto the Supreme Lord is very rare (<span class="Italic">sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ</span>). Consequently Lord Śiva came especially to see the Pracetās because they were fully surrendered unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva. Vāsudeva is also mentioned in the beginning of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> in the <span class="Italic">mantra, oṁ namo bhagavate vāsudevāya.</span> Since Vāsudeva is the ultimate truth, Lord Śiva openly proclaims that one who is a devotee of Lord Vāsudeva, who is surrendered to Lord Kṛṣṇa, is actually very dear to him. Lord Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is worshipable not only by ordinary living entities but by demigods like Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā and others. <span class="Italic">Yaṁ brahmā-varuṇendra-rudra-marutaḥ stuvanti divyaiḥ stavaiḥ</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 12.13.1). Kṛṣṇa is worshiped by Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Varuṇa, Indra, Candra and all other demigods. That is also the situation with a devotee. Indeed, one who takes to Kṛṣṇa consciousness immediately becomes very dear to anyone who is simply finding out and beginning to understand what Kṛṣṇa consciousness actually is. Similarly, all the demigods are also trying to find out who is actually surrendered to Lord Vāsudeva. Because the Pracetā princes were surrendered to Vāsudeva, Lord Śiva willingly came forth to see them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Vāsudeva, or Kṛṣṇa, is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as Puruṣottama. Actually He is the enjoyer (<span class="Italic">puruṣa</span>) and the Supreme (<span class="Italic">uttama</span>) as well. He is the enjoyer of everything—the <span class="Italic">prakṛti</span> and the <span class="Italic">puruṣa.</span> Being influenced by the three modes of material nature, the living entity tries to dominate material nature, but actually he is not the <span class="Italic">puruṣa</span> (enjoyer) but <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> as described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.5): <span class="Italic">apareyam itas tv anyāṁ prakṛtiṁ viddhi me parām.</span> Thus the <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> or living entity, is actually <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> or the marginal energy of the Supreme Lord. Being associated with material energy, he tries to lord it over the material nature. This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (15.7):
          </p>

            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            “The living entities in this conditioned world are My eternal fragmental parts. Due to conditioned life, they are struggling very hard with the six senses, which include the mind.”
          </p>
          <p>
            By endeavoring to dominate material nature, the living entity simply struggles hard for existence. Indeed, he struggles so hard to enjoy himself that he cannot even enjoy the material resources. Thus he is sometimes called <span class="Italic">prakṛti,</span> or <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> for he is situated in the marginal potency. When the living entity is covered with the three modes of material nature, he is called <span class="Italic">jīva-saṁjñita.</span> There are two kinds of living entities: one is called <span class="Italic">kṣara,</span> and the other is <span class="Italic">akṣara.</span> <span class="Italic">Kṣara</span> refers to those who have fallen down and become conditioned, and <span class="Italic">akṣara</span> refers to those who are not conditioned. The vast majority of living entities live in the spiritual world and are called <span class="Italic">akṣara.</span> They are in the position of Brahman, pure spiritual existence. They are different from those who have been conditioned by the three modes of material nature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Being above both the <span class="Italic">kṣara</span> and <span class="Italic">akṣara,</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (15.18) as Puruṣottama. The impersonalists may say that Vāsudeva is the impersonal Brahman, but actually the impersonal Brahman is subordinate to Kṛṣṇa, as also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (14.27): <span class="Italic">brahmaṇo hi pratiṣṭhāham.</span> That Kṛṣṇa is the source of the impersonal Brahman is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> (5.40): <span class="Italic">yasya prabhā prabhavato jagadaṇḍa-koṭi.</span> The impersonal Brahman is nothing but the effulgence or bodily rays of Kṛṣṇa, and in those bodily rays there are innumerable universes floating. Thus in all respects Vāsudeva, Kṛṣṇa, is the Supreme Lord, and Lord Śiva is very satisfied with those who are completely surrendered to Him. Complete surrender is desired by Kṛṣṇa, as He indicates in the last chapter of <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (18.66): <span class="Italic">sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ śaraṇaṁ vraja.</span> The word <span class="Italic">sākṣāt,</span> meaning “directly,” is very significant. There are many so-called devotees, but actually they are only <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> and <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> for they are not directly devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa. The <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> sometimes offer the results of their activities to Lord Vāsudeva, and this offering is called <span class="Italic">karmārpaṇam.</span> These are considered to be fruitive activities, for the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> consider Lord Viṣṇu to be one of the demigods like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. Because they consider Lord Viṣṇu to be on the same level with the demigods, they contend that surrendering to the demigods is as good as surrendering unto Vāsudeva. This contention is denied herein because if it were true, Lord Śiva would have said that surrender unto him, Lord Vāsudeva, Viṣṇu or Brahmā is the same. However, Lord Śiva does not say this because he himself surrenders unto Vāsudeva, and whoever else surrenders unto Vāsudeva is very, very dear to him. This is expressed herein openly. The conclusion is that a devotee of Lord Śiva is not dear to Lord Śiva, but a devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa is very dear to Lord Śiva.

            This verse gives an idea of the highest perfection of the evolutionary process. As described by the Vaiṣṇava poet Jayadeva Gosvāmī, <span class="Italic">pralaya-payodhi jale dhṛtavān asi vedam **.</span> Let us begin tracing the evolutionary process from the point of devastation (<span class="Italic">pralaya</span>), when the whole universe is filled with water. At that time there are many fishes and other aquatics, and from these aquatics evolve creepers, trees, etc. From these, insects and reptiles evolve, and from them birds, beasts and then human beings and finally civilized human beings. Now, the civilized human being is at a junction where he can make further evolutionary progress in spiritual life. Here it is stated (<span class="Italic">sva-dharma-niṣṭhaḥ</span>) that when a living entity comes to a civilized form of life, there must be <span class="Italic">sva-dharma,</span> social divisions according to one’s work and qualifications. This is indicated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (4.13):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">cātur-varṇyaṁ mayā sṛṣṭaṁ<br>guṇa-karma-vibhāgaśaḥ</div>

          </p>
          <p>
            “According to the three modes of material nature and the work ascribed to them, the four divisions of human society were created by Me.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In civilized human society there must be the divisions of <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra,</span> and everyone must properly execute his occupational duty in accordance with his division. Here it is described (<span class="Italic">svadharma-niṣṭhaḥ</span>) that it does not matter whether one is a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</span> or <span class="Italic">śūdra.</span> If one sticks to his position and properly executes his particular duty, he is considered a civilized human being. Otherwise he is no better than an animal. It is also mentioned herein that whoever executes his occupational duty (<span class="Italic">sva-dharma</span>) for one hundred births (for instance, if a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> continues to act as a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span>) becomes eligible for promotion to Brahmaloka, the planet where Lord Brahmā lives. There is also a planet called Śivaloka, or Sadāśivaloka, which is situated in a marginal position between the spiritual and material worlds. If, after being situated in Brahmaloka, one becomes more qualified, he is promoted to Sadāśivaloka. Similarly, when one becomes even more qualified, he can attain the Vaikuṇṭhalokas. The Vaikuṇṭhalokas are targets for everyone, even the demigods, and they can be attained by a devotee who has no desire for material benefit. As indicated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (8.16), one does not escape material miseries even if he is elevated to Brahmaloka (<span class="Italic">ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ punar āvartino ’rjuna</span>). Similarly, one is not very safe even if he is promoted to Śivaloka, because the planet of Śivaloka is marginal. However, if one attains Vaikuṇṭhaloka, he attains the highest perfection of life and the end of the evolutionary process (<span class="Italic">mām upetya tu kaunteya punar janma na vidyate</span>). In other words, it is confirmed herein that a person in human society who has developed consciousness must take to Kṛṣṇa consciousness in order to be promoted to Vaikuṇṭhaloka or Kṛṣṇaloka immediately after leaving the body. <span class="Italic">Tyaktvā dehaṁ punar janma naiti mām eti so ’rjuna</span> (Bg. 4.9). A devotee who is fully in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, who is not attracted by any other <span class="Italic">loka,</span> or planet, including Brahmaloka and Śivaloka, is immediately transferred to Kṛṣṇaloka (<span class="Italic">mām eti</span>). That is the highest perfection of life and the perfection of the evolutionary process.

            It is said, <span class="Italic">vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathā śambhuḥ:</span> Lord Śiva is the best of all devotees. Therefore all devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa are also devotees of Lord Śiva. In Vṛndāvana there is Lord Śiva’s temple called Gopīśvara. The <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> used to worship not only Lord Śiva but Kātyāyanī, or Durgā, as well, but their aim was to attain the favor of Lord Kṛṣṇa. A devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa does not disrespect Lord Śiva, but worships Lord Śiva as the most exalted devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. Consequently whenever a devotee worships Lord Śiva, he prays to Lord Śiva to achieve the favor of Kṛṣṇa, and he does not request material profit. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.20) it is said that generally people worship demigods for some material profit. <span class="Italic">Kāmais tais tair hṛta jñānāḥ.</span> Driven by material lust, they worship demigods, but a devotee never does so, for he is never driven by material lust. That is the difference between a devotee’s respect for Lord Śiva and an <span class="Italic">asura’s</span> respect for him. The <span class="Italic">asura</span> worships Lord Śiva, takes some benediction from him, misuses the benediction and ultimately is killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who awards him liberation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because Lord Śiva is a great devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he loves all the devotees of the Supreme Lord. Lord Śiva told the Pracetās that because they were devotees of the Lord, he loved them very much. Lord Śiva was not kind and merciful only to the Pracetās; anyone who is a devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very dear to Lord Śiva. Not only are the devotees dear to Lord Śiva, but he respects them as much as he respects the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, devotees of the Supreme Lord also worship Lord Śiva as the most dear devotee of Lord Kṛṣṇa. They do not worship him as a separate Personality of Godhead. It is stated in the list of <span class="Italic">nāma-aparādhas</span> that it is an offense to think that the chanting of the name of Hari and the chanting of Hara, or Śiva, are the same. The devotees must always know that Lord Viṣṇu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and that Lord Śiva is His devotee. A devotee should be offered respect on the level of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and sometimes even more respect. Indeed, Lord Rāma, the Personality of Godhead Himself, sometimes worshiped Lord Śiva. If a devotee is worshiped by the Lord, why should a devotee not be worshiped by other devotees on the same level with the Lord? This is the conclusion. From this verse it appears that Lord Śiva blesses the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> simply for the sake of formality. Actually he loves one who is devoted to the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            Lord Śiva addressed the Supreme Personality of Godhead with the following prayer: O Supreme Personality of Godhead, all glories unto You. You are the most exalted of all self-realized souls. Since You are always auspicious for the self-realized, I wish that You be auspicious for me.

            As soon as a devotee is inspired by the Lord to offer the Lord a prayer, the devotee immediately glorifies the Lord in the beginning by saying, “All glories unto You, my Lord.” The Lord is glorified because He is considered to be the chief of all self-realized souls. As said in the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Kaṭha Upaniṣad</span> 2.2.13), <span class="Italic">nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām:</span> the Supreme Being, the Personality of Godhead, is the chief living being amongst all living beings. There are different kinds of individual living beings—some of them are in this material world, and some are in the spiritual world. Those who are in the spiritual world are known to be completely self-realized because on the spiritual platform the living entity is not forgetful of his service to the Lord. Therefore in the spiritual world all those who are in the devotional service of the Lord are eternally fixed, for they understand the position of the Supreme Being, as well as their individual constitution. Thus amongst self-realized souls, the Lord is known as the perfectly self-realized soul. <span class="Italic">Nityo nityānāṁ cetanaś cetanānām.</span> When the individual soul is fixed in his knowledge of the Lord as the Supreme Being, he actually becomes established in an all-auspicious position. Lord Śiva prays herein that his auspicious position continue eternally by virtue of the Lord’s mercy upon him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Supreme Lord is all-perfect, and the Lord instructs that one who worships Him also becomes perfect. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (15.15): <span class="Italic">mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca.</span> The Lord is situated as the Supersoul in everyone’s heart, but He is so kind to His devotees that He gives them instructions by which they may continue to progress. When they receive instructions from the all-perfect, there is no chance of their being misled. This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.10): <span class="Italic">dadāmi buddhi-yogaṁ taṁ yena mām upayānti te.</span> The Lord is always ready to give instructions to the pure devotee so that the devotee can advance further and further in devotional service. Since the Lord gives instructions as <span class="Italic">sarvātmā,</span> the Supersoul, Lord Śiva offers Him respect with the words <span class="Italic">sarvātmā ātmane namaḥ.</span> The individual soul is called <span class="Italic">ātmā,</span> and the Lord is also called <span class="Italic">ātmā</span> as well as Paramātmā. Being situated in everyone’s heart, the Lord is known as the supreme <span class="Italic">ātmā.</span> Therefore all obeisances are offered unto Him. In this regard, one may refer to the prayers of Kuntī in the First Canto of <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (1.8.20):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lord is always ready to give instructions to the <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsas,</span> or the topmost devotees of the Lord, who are completely liberated from all contaminations of the material world. The Lord always gives instructions to such exalted devotees to inform them how they can remain fixed in devotional service. Similarly, it is stated in the <span class="Italic">ātmārāma</span> verse (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 1.7.10):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

          <p>
            The word <span class="Italic">ātmārāma</span> refers to those who are not interested in the material world but are simply engaged in spiritual realization. Such self-realized persons are generally considered in two categories—impersonal and personal. However, impersonalists also become devotees when they are attracted by the personal transcendental qualities of the Lord. The conclusion is that Lord Śiva wanted to remain a fixed devotee of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vāsudeva. As explained in the following verses, Lord Śiva never desires to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord like the impersonalists. Rather, he thinks that it would be good fortune for him to continue to be fixed in the understanding of the Lord as the Supreme Being. By this understanding, one realizes that all living entities—including Lord Śiva, Lord Brahmā and other demigods—are servants of the Supreme Lord.

            The Lord as Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu lies in the ocean of Garbha within this universe, and from His navel the lotus flower sprouts. Lord Brahmā is generated from that lotus flower, and from Lord Brahmā the creation of this material world begins. As such, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Garbhodakaśāyī Viṣṇu, is the origin of the material senses and sense objects. Since Lord Śiva considers himself to be one of the products of the material world, his senses are under the control of the supreme creator. The Supreme Lord is also known as Hṛṣīkeśa, master of the senses, which indicates that our senses and sense objects are formed by the Supreme Lord. As such, He can control our senses and out of His mercy engage them in the service of the master of the senses. In the conditioned state, the living entity struggles in this material world and engages his senses for material satisfaction. However, if the living entity is graced by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he can engage these very senses in the service of the Lord. Lord Śiva desires not to be misled by the material senses but to engage always in the service of the Lord without being subject to contamination by materialistic influences. By the grace and help of Lord Vāsudeva, who is all-pervading, one can engage his senses in devotional service without deviation, just as the Lord acts without deviation.

            The words <span class="Italic">śāntāya kūṭa-sthāya sva-rociṣe</span> are very significant. Although the Lord is within this material world, He is not disturbed by the waves of material existence. However, conditioned souls are agitated by six kinds of transformations; namely, they become agitated when they are hungry, when they are thirsty, when they are aggrieved, when they are illusioned, when they grow old and when they are on the deathbed. Although conditioned souls become very easily illusioned by these conditions in the material world, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as the Supersoul, Vāsudeva, is never agitated by these transformations. Therefore it is said here (<span class="Italic">kūṭa-sthāya</span>) that He is always peaceful and devoid of agitation because of His prowess, which is described herein as <span class="Italic">sva-rociṣe,</span> indicating that He is illuminated by His own transcendental position. In other words, the individual soul, although within the illumination of the Supreme, sometimes falls down from that illumination because of his tiny position, and when he falls down he enters into material, conditional life. The Lord, however, is not subject to such conditioning; therefore He is described as self-illuminated. Consequently any conditioned soul within this material universe can remain completely perfect when he is under the protection of Vāsudeva, or when he is engaged in devotional service.

            The whole universe is maintained by the integrating power of the Supreme Lord, who is known in that capacity by the name Saṅkarṣaṇa. The material scientists may have discovered the law of gravity, which maintains the integration of objects within the material energy, yet the master of all integration can create devastation by the disintegrating blazing fire emanating from His mouth. A description of this can be found in the Eleventh Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> wherein the universal form of the Lord is described. The master of integration is also the destroyer of this world by virtue of His disintegrating energy. Saṅkarṣaṇa is the master of integration and disintegration, whereas Pradyumna, another feature of Lord Vāsudeva, is responsible for universal growth and maintenance. The word <span class="Italic">sūkṣmāya</span> is significant because within this gross material body there are subtle material bodies—namely mind, intelligence and ego. The Lord in His different features (Vāsudeva, Aniruddha, Pradyumna and Saṅkarṣaṇa) maintains both the gross and subtle material elements of this world. As mentioned in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> the gross material elements are earth, water, fire, air and ether, and the subtle material elements are mind, intelligence and ego. All of them are controlled by the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha, and this will be further explained in the following verse.

            <span class="Italic">Hṛṣīkeśendriyātmane.</span> The mind is the director of the senses, and Lord Aniruddha is the director of the mind. In order to execute devotional service, one has to fix his mind on the lotus feet of Kṛṣṇa; therefore Lord Śiva prays to the controller of the mind, Lord Aniruddha, to be pleased to help him engage his mind on the lotus feet of the Lord. It is stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.34): <span class="Italic">man-manā bhava mad-bhakto mad-yājī mām.</span> <span class="Italic">namaskuru.</span> The mind has to be engaged in meditation on the lotus feet of the Lord in order to execute devotional service. It is also stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (15.15), <span class="Italic">mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca:</span> from the Lord come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness. Thus if Lord Aniruddha is pleased, He can help the mind engage in the service of the Lord. It is also indicated in this verse that Lord Aniruddha is the sun-god by virtue of His expansions. Since the predominating deity of the sun is an expansion of Lord Aniruddha, Lord Śiva also prays to the sun-god in this verse.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Kṛṣṇa, by His quadruple expansion (Vāsudeva, Saṅkarṣaṇa, Pradyumna and Aniruddha), is the Lord of psychic action—namely thinking, feeling, willing and acting. Lord Śiva prays to Lord Aniruddha as the sun-god, who is the controlling deity of the external material elements which constitute the construction of the material body. According to Śrīla Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, the word <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> is also another name for the sun-god. The sun-god is addressed herein as <span class="Italic">nibhṛtātmane,</span> which indicates that he always maintains the various planets by manipulating the rainfall. The sun-god evaporates water from the seas and oceans and then forms the water into clouds and distributes it over land. When there is sufficient rainfall grains are produced, and these grains maintain living entities in each and every planet. The sun-god is also addressed herein as <span class="Italic">pūrṇa,</span> or complete, because the rays emanating from the sun have no end. For millions and millions of years since the creation of this universe, the sun-god has been supplying heat and light without diminution. The word <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa</span> is applied to persons who are completely cleansed. When there is sufficient sunshine, the mind remains clear and transparent—in other words, the sun-god helps the mind of the living entity to become situated on the platform of <span class="Italic">paramahaṁsa.</span> Thus Lord Śiva prays to Aniruddha to be kind upon him so that his mind will always be in the perfect state of cleanliness and will be engaged in the devotional service of the Lord. Just as fire sterilizes all unclean things, the sun-god also keeps everything sterilized, especially dirty things within the mind, thus enabling one to attain elevation to the platform of spiritual understanding.

            As the individual body of the living entity is composed of millions of cells, germs and microbes, the universal body of the Supreme Lord similarly contains all the individual bodies of the living entities. Lord Śiva is offering his obeisances to the universal body, which includes all other bodies, so that everyone’s body may fully engage in devotional service. Since this individual body is composed of senses, all the senses should be engaged in devotional service. For instance, the smelling instrument, the nose, can engage in smelling the flowers offered to the lotus feet of the Lord, the hands can engage in cleansing the temple of the Lord, etc. Indeed, being the life air of every living entity, the Lord is the maintainer of the three worlds. Consequently He can induce every living entity to engage in his real life’s duty with full bodily and mental strength. Thus every living entity should serve the Supreme Personality of Godhead by his <span class="Italic">prāṇa</span> (life), <span class="Italic">artha</span> (wealth), intelligence and words.

            Vedic evidence is called <span class="Italic">śabda-brahma.</span> There are many things which are beyond the perception of our imperfect senses, yet the authoritative evidence of sound vibration is perfect. The <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> are known as <span class="Italic">śabda-brahma</span> because evidence taken from the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> constitutes the ultimate understanding. This is because <span class="Italic">śabda-brahma,</span> or the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> represents the Supreme Personality of Godhead. However, the real essence of <span class="Italic">śabda-brahma</span> is the chanting of the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra.</span> By vibrating this transcendental sound, the meaning of everything, both material and spiritual, is revealed. This Hare Kṛṣṇa is nondifferent from the Personality of Godhead. The meaning of everything is received through the air through sound vibration. The vibration may be material or spiritual, but without sound vibration no one can understand the meaning of anything. In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is said, <span class="Italic">antar bahiś ca tat sarvaṁ vyāya nārāyaṇaḥ sthitaḥ:</span> “Nārāyaṇa is all-pervading, and He exists both within and without.” This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (13.34):

          </p>
          <p>
            In other words, the consciousness of both the soul and Supersoul is all-pervading; the limited consciousness of the living entity is pervading the entire material body, and the supreme consciousness of the Lord is pervading the entire universe. Because the soul is present within the body, consciousness pervades the entire body; similarly, because the supreme soul, or Kṛṣṇa, is present within this universe, everything is working in order. <span class="Italic">Mayādhyakṣeṇa prakṛtiḥ sūyate sa-carācaram:</span> “This material nature is working under My direction, O son of Kuntī, and it is producing all moving and unmoving beings.” (Bg. 9.10)
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Śiva is therefore praying to the Personality of Godhead to be kind to us so that simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> we can understand everything in both the material and spiritual worlds. The word <span class="Italic">amuṣmai</span> is significant in this regard because it indicates the best target one can aim for after attaining the higher planetary systems. Those who are engaged in fruitive activities (<span class="Italic">karmīs</span>) attain the higher planetary systems as a result of their past activities, and the <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> who seek unification or a monistic merging with the effulgence of the Supreme Lord, also attain their desired end, but in the ultimate issue, the devotees, who desire to personally associate with the Lord, are promoted to the Vaikuṇṭhalokas or Goloka Vṛndāvana. The Lord is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.12) as <span class="Italic">pavitraṁ paramam,</span> the supreme pure. This is also confirmed in this verse. Śukadeva Gosvāmī has stated that the cowherd boys who played with Lord Kṛṣṇa were not ordinary living entities. Only after accumulating many pious activities in various births does one get the opportunity to personally associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since only the pure can reach Him, He is the supreme pure.

            The Supreme Personality of Godhead causes the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> to forget Him and the devotees to remember Him. One’s disinclinations are due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. According to <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (16.7), <span class="Italic">pravṛttiṁ ca nivṛttiṁ ca janā na vidur āsurāḥ:</span> the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> do not know which way one should be inclined to act and which way one should not be inclined to act. Although the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> oppose devotional service, it is to be understood that they are inclined that way due to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because the <span class="Italic">asuras</span> do not like to engage in the Lord’s devotional service, the Lord within gives them the intelligence to forget. Ordinary <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> desire promotion to Pitṛloka, as confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.25). <span class="Italic">Yānti deva-vratā devān pitṝn yānti pitṛ-vratāḥ:</span> “Those who worship the demigods will take birth among the demigods, and those who worship ancestors go to the ancestors.”
          </p>
          <p>
            In this verse the word <span class="Italic">duḥkha-dāya</span> is also very significant, for those who are nondevotees are perpetually put into the cycle of birth and death. This is a very miserable condition. Because one’s position in life is attained according to one’s activities, the <span class="Italic">asuras,</span> or nondevotees, are put into such miserable conditions.

            The words <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇāya akuṇṭha-medhase</span> are significant in this verse. Modern scientists have stopped their brainwork by discovering the theory of uncertainty, but factually for a living being there cannot be any brain activity which is not checked by time and space limitations. A living entity is called <span class="Italic">aṇu,</span> an atomic particle of the supreme soul, and therefore his brain is also atomic. It cannot accommodate unlimited knowledge. This does not mean, however, that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa, has a limited brain. What Kṛṣṇa says and does is not limited by time and space. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.26) the Lord says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">vedāhaṁ samatītāni<br>vartamānāni cārjuna<br>bhaviṣyāṇi ca bhūtāni<br>māṁ tu veda na kaścana</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “O Arjuna, as the Supreme Personality of Godhead, I know everything that has happened in the past, all that is happening in the present, and all things that are yet to come. I also know all living entities; but Me no one knows.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Kṛṣṇa knows everything, but one cannot know Kṛṣṇa without being favored by Him. Thus for Kṛṣṇa and His representative there is no question of a theory of uncertainty. What Kṛṣṇa says is all perfect and certain and is applicable to the past, present and future. Nor is there any uncertainty for one who knows exactly what Kṛṣṇa says. The Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is based on <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, as spoken by Lord Kṛṣṇa, and for those who are engaged in this movement, there is no question of uncertainty.
          </p>
          <p>
            Lord Kṛṣṇa is also addressed herein as <span class="Italic">āśiṣām īśa.</span> The great saintly personalities, sages and demigods are able to offer benedictions to ordinary living entities, but they in turn are benedicted by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Without being benedicted by Kṛṣṇa, one cannot offer benediction to anyone else. The word <span class="Italic">manave,</span> meaning “unto the supreme Manu,” is also significant. The supreme Manu in Vedic literature is Svāyambhuva Manu, who is an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa. All the Manus are empowered incarnations of Kṛṣṇa (<span class="Italic">manvantara-avatāra</span>). There are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahmā, 420 in one month, all the Manus are directors of human society, ultimately Kṛṣṇa is the supreme director of human society. In another sense, the word <span class="Italic">manave</span> indicates the perfection of all kinds of <span class="Italic">mantras.</span> The <span class="Italic">mantra</span> delivers the conditioned soul from his bondage; so simply by chanting the <span class="Italic">mantra</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare, one can gain deliverance from any condition.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span class="Italic">Kāraṇātmane:</span> everything has a cause. The theory of chance is repudiated in this verse. Because everything has its cause, there is no question of chance. Because so-called philosophers and scientists are unable to find the real cause, they foolishly say that everything happens by chance. In <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> Kṛṣṇa is described as the cause of all causes; therefore He is addressed herein as <span class="Italic">kāraṇātmane.</span> His very personality is the original cause of everything, the root of everything and the seed of everything. As described in the <span class="Ref_Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> (1.1.2), <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ: [SB 1.1.1]</span> the Absolute Truth is the supreme cause of all emanations.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya-yogeśvarāya</span> is also significant herein, for Kṛṣṇa is described in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as Yogeśvara, the master of all mystic powers. Without possessing inconceivable mystic powers, one cannot be accepted as God. In this age of Kali, those who have a little fragmental portion of mystic power claim to be God, but such pseudo Gods can only be accepted as fools, for only Kṛṣṇa is the Supreme Person who possesses all mystic and yogic perfections. The <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya-yoga</span> system popular at the present moment was propounded by the atheist Kapila, but the original <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya-yoga</span> system was propounded by an incarnation of Kṛṣṇa also named Kapila, the son of Devahūti. Similarly, Dattātreya, another incarnation of Kṛṣṇa, also explained the <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya-yoga</span> system. Thus Kṛṣṇa is the origin of all <span class="Italic">sāṅkhya-yoga</span> systems and mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> powers.
          </p>
          <p>
            The words <span class="Italic">puruṣāya purāṇāya</span> are also worthy of special attention. In <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā,</span> Kṛṣṇa is accepted as the <span class="Italic">ādi-puruṣa,</span> the original person, or the original enjoyer. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> Lord Kṛṣṇa is also accepted as <span class="Italic">purāṇa-puruṣa,</span> the oldest person. Although He is the oldest of all personalities, He is also the youngest of all, or <span class="Italic">nava-yauvana.</span> Another significant word is <span class="Italic">dharmāya.</span> Since Kṛṣṇa is the original propounder of all kinds of religious principles, it is said: <span class="Italic">dharmaṁ tu sākṣād bhagavat-praṇītam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 6.3.19). No one can introduce a new type of religion, for religion is already there, having been established by Lord Kṛṣṇa. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> Kṛṣṇa informs us of the original <span class="Italic">dharma</span> and asks us to give up all kinds of religious principles. The real <span class="Italic">dharma</span> is surrender unto Him. In the <span class="Italic">Mahābhārata,</span> it is also said:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">ye ca veda-vido viprā<br>ye cādhyātma-vido janāḥ<br>te vadanti mahātmānaṁ<br>kṛṣṇaṁ dharmaṁ sanātanam</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            The purport is that one who has studied the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> perfectly, who is a perfect <span class="Italic">vipra,</span> or knower of the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> who knows what spiritual life actually is, speaks about Kṛṣṇa, the Supreme Person, as one’s <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span> Lord Śiva therefore teaches us the principles of <span class="Italic">sanātana-dharma.</span>

            My dear Lord, You are the supreme controller of the worker, sense activities and results of sense activities [karma]. Therefore You are the controller of the body, mind and senses. You are also the supreme controller of egotism, known as Rudra. You are the source of knowledge and the activities of the Vedic injunctions.

            Everyone acts under the dictation of the ego. Therefore Lord Śiva is trying to purify false egotism through the mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Since Lord Śiva, or Rudra, is himself the controller of egotism, he indirectly wants to be purified by the mercy of the Lord so that his real egotism can be awakened. Of course, Lord Rudra is always spiritually awake, but for our benefit he is praying in this way. For the am spirit soul.” But in its actual position, the spirit soul has devotional activities to perform. Therefore Lord Śiva prays to be engaged both in mind and in action in the devotional service of the Supreme Lord according to the direction of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> This is the process for purifying false egotism. <span class="Italic">Cetaḥ</span> means “knowledge.” Without perfect knowledge, one cannot act perfectly. The real source of knowledge is the <span class="Italic">vācaḥ,</span> or sound vibration, given by Vedic instructions. Here the word <span class="Italic">vācaḥ,</span> or vibration, means the Vedic vibration. The origin of creation is sound vibration, and if the sound vibration is clear and purified, perfect knowledge and perfect activities actually become manifest. This is enacted by the chanting of the <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra,</span> Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare. Thus Lord Śiva is praying again and again for the purification of body, mind and activities through the purification of knowledge and action under the pure directions of the <span class="Italic">Vedas.</span> Lord Śiva prays to the Supreme Personality of Godhead so that his mind, senses and words will all turn toward devotional activities only.

            In the <span class="Italic">śruti,</span> or <span class="Italic">veda-mantra,</span> it is said that the Supreme Absolute Truth is <span class="Italic">sarva-kāmaḥ sarva-gandhaḥ sarva-rasaḥ,</span> or, in other words, He is known as <span class="Italic">raso vai saḥ,</span> the source of all relishable relationships (<span class="Italic">rasas</span>). We have various senses—the powers of seeing, tasting, smelling, touching, etc.—and all the propensities of our senses can be satisfied when the senses are engaged in the service of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Hṛṣīkeṇa hṛṣīkeśa-sevanaṁ bhaktir ucyate:</span> <span class="Italic">“Bhakti</span> means engaging all the senses in the service of the master of the senses, Hṛṣīkeśa.” (<span class="Italic">Nārada-pañcarātra</span>) These material senses, however, cannot be engaged in the service of the Lord; therefore one has to become free from all designations. <span class="Italic">Sarvopādhi-vinirmuktaṁ tatparatvena nirmalam</span> [Cc. Madhya 19.170]<span class="Italic">.</span> One has to become free from all designation or false egotism and thus become purified. When we engage our senses in the service of the Lord, the desires or the inclinations of the senses can be perfectly fulfilled. Lord Śiva therefore wants to see the Lord in a form which is inconceivable to the Bauddha philosophers, or the Buddhists.
          </p>
          <p>
            The impersonalists and the voidists also have to see the form of the Absolute. In Buddhist temples there are forms of Lord Buddha in meditation, but these are not worshiped like the forms of the Lord in Vaiṣṇava temples (forms like Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, Sītā-Rāma or Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa). Amongst the different <span class="Italic">sampradāyas</span> (Vaiṣṇava sects) either Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa or Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa is worshiped. Lord Śiva wants to see that form perfectly, just as the devotees want to see it. I he words <span class="Italic">rūpaṁ priyatamaṁ svānām</span> are specifically mentioned here, indicating that Lord Śiva wants to see that form which is very dear to the devotees. The word <span class="Italic">svānām</span> is especially significant because only the devotees are very, very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The <span class="Italic">jñānīs, yogīs</span> and <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> are not particularly dear, for the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> simply want to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as their order supplier. The <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> want to see Him to become one with Him, and the <span class="Italic">yogīs</span> want to see Him partially represented within their heart as Paramātmā, but the <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> or the devotees, want to see Him in His complete perfection. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> (5.30):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            “I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is adept at playing on His flute, whose eyes are blooming like lotus petals, whose head is bedecked with peacock feathers, whose beauty is tinged with the hue of blue clouds, and whose unique loveliness charms millions of Cupids.” Thus Lord Śiva’s desire is to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead as He is described in this way—that is, he wants to see Him as He appears to the <span class="Italic">bhāgavatas,</span> the devotees. The conclusion is that Lord Śiva wants to see Him in complete perfection and not in the impersonalist or voidist way. Although the Lord is one in His various forms (<span class="Italic">advaitam acyutam anādim</span>), still His form as the young enjoyer of the <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> and companion of the cowherd boys (<span class="Italic">kiśora-mūrti</span>) is the most perfect form. Thus Vaiṣṇavas accept the form of the Lord in His Vṛndāvana pastimes as the chief form.

            The Lord’s beauty resembles a dark cloud during the rainy season. As the rainfall glistens, His bodily features also glisten. Indeed, He is the sum total of all beauty. The Lord has four arms and an exquisitely beautiful face with eyes like lotus petals, a beautiful highly raised nose, a mind-attracting smile, a beautiful forehead and equally beautiful and fully decorated ears.

            After the scorching heat of the summer season, it is very pleasing to see dark clouds in the sky. As confirmed in <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā:</span> <span class="Italic">barhāvataṁsam asitāmbuda-sundarāṅgam.</span> The Lord wears a peacock feather in His hair, and His bodily complexion is just like a blackish cloud. The word <span class="Italic">sundara,</span> or <span class="Italic">snigdha,</span> means “very pleasing.” <span class="Italic">Kandarpa-koṭi-kamanīya.</span> Kṛṣṇa’s beauty is so pleasing that not even millions upon millions of Cupids can compare to it. The Lord’s form as Viṣṇu is decorated in all opulence; therefore Lord Śiva is trying to see that most opulent form of Nārāyaṇa, or Viṣṇu. Generally the worship of the Lord begins with the worship of Nārāyaṇa, or Viṣṇu, whereas the worship of Lord Kṛṣṇa and Rādhā is most confidential. Lord Nārāyaṇa is worshipable by the <span class="Italic">pāñcarātrika-vidhi,</span> or regulative principles, whereas Lord Kṛṣṇa is worshipable by the <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-vidhi.</span> No one can worship the Lord in the <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-vidhi</span> without going through the regulations of the <span class="Italic">pāñcarātrika-vidhi.</span> Actually, neophyte devotees worship the Lord according to the <span class="Italic">pāñcarātrika-vidhi,</span> or the regulative principles enjoined in the <span class="Italic">Nārada-pañcarātra.</span> Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa cannot be approached by the neophyte devotees; therefore temple worship according to regulative principles is offered to Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. Although there may be a Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">vigraha,</span> or form, the worship of the neophyte devotees is acceptable as Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa worship. Worship according to the <span class="Italic">pāñcarātrika-vidhi</span> is called <span class="Italic">vidhi-mārga,</span> and worship according to the <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-vidhi</span> principles is called <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga.</span> The principles of <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga</span> are especially meant for devotees who are elevated to the Vṛndāvana platform.
          </p>
          <p>
            The inhabitants of Vṛndāvana—the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> mother Yaśodā, Nanda Mahārāja, the cowherd boys, the cows and everyone else—are actually on the <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga</span> or <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-mārga</span> platform. They participate in five basic <span class="Italic">rasas—dāsya, sakhya, vātsalya, mādhurya</span> and <span class="Italic">śānta.</span> But although these five <span class="Italic">rasas</span> are found in the <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-mārga,</span> the <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-mārga</span> is especially meant for <span class="Italic">vātsalya</span> and <span class="Italic">mādhurya,</span> or paternal and conjugal relationships. Yet there is the <span class="Italic">vipralambha-sakhya,</span> the higher fraternal worship of the Lord especially enjoyed by the cowherd boys. Although there is friendship between Kṛṣṇa and the cowherd boys, this friendship is different from the <span class="Italic">aiśvarya</span> friendship between Kṛṣṇa and Arjuna. When Arjuna saw the <span class="Italic">viśva-rūpa,</span> the gigantic universal form of the Lord, he was afraid for having treated Kṛṣṇa as an ordinary friend; therefore he begged Kṛṣṇa’s pardon. However, the cowherd boys who are friends of Kṛṣṇa in Vṛndāvana sometimes ride on the shoulders of Kṛṣṇa. They treat Kṛṣṇa equally, just as they treat one another, and they are never afraid of Him, nor do they ever beg His pardon. Thus the <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga,</span> or <span class="Italic">bhāgavata-mārga,</span> friendship exists on a higher platform with Kṛṣṇa, namely the platform of <span class="Italic">vipralambha</span> friendship. Paternal friendship, paternal service and conjugal service are visible in the Vṛndāvana <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga</span> relationships.
          </p>
          <p>
            Without serving Kṛṣṇa according to the <span class="Italic">vidhi-mārga</span> regulative principles of the <span class="Italic">pāñcarātrika-vidhi,</span> unscrupulous persons want to jump immediately to the <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga</span> principles. Such persons are called <span class="Italic">sahajiyā.</span> There are also demons who enjoy depicting Kṛṣṇa and His pastimes with the <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> taking advantage of Kṛṣṇa by their licentious character. These demons who print books and write lyrics on the <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga</span> principles are surely on the way to hell. Unfortunately, they lead others down with them. Devotees in Kṛṣṇa consciousness should be very careful to avoid such demons. One should strictly follow the <span class="Italic">vidhi-mārga</span> regulative principles in the worship of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa, although the Lord is present in the temple as Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa. Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa includes Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa; therefore when one worships the Lord according to the regulative principles, the Lord accepts the service in the role of Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. In <span class="Italic">The Nectar of Devotion</span> full instructions are given about the <span class="Italic">vidhi-mārga</span> worship of Rādhā-Kṛṣṇa, or Lakṣmī-Nārāyaṇa. Although there are sixty-four kinds of offenses one can commit in <span class="Italic">vidhi-mārga</span> worship, in <span class="Italic">rāga-mārga</span> worship there is no consideration of such offenses because the devotees on that platform are very much elevated, and there is no question of offense. But if we do not follow the regulative principles on the <span class="Italic">vidhi-mārga</span> platform and keep our eyes trained to spot offenses, we will not make progress.
          </p>
          <p>
            In his description of Kṛṣṇa’s beauty, Lord Śiva uses the words <span class="Italic">cārvāyata-catur-bāhu sujāta-rucirānanam,</span> indicating the beautiful four-armed form of Nārāyaṇa, or Viṣṇu. Those who worship Lord Kṛṣṇa describe Him as <span class="Italic">sujāta-rucirānanam.</span> In the <span class="Italic">viṣṇu-tattva</span> there are hundreds and thousands and millions of forms of the Supreme Lord, but of all these forms, the form of Kṛṣṇa is the most beautiful. Thus for those who worship Kṛṣṇa, the word <span class="Italic">sujāta-rucirānanam</span> is used.
          </p>
          <p>
            The four arms of Lord Viṣṇu have different purposes. The hands holding a lotus flower and conchshell are meant for the devotees, whereas the other two hands, holding a disc and mace, or club, are meant for the demons. Actually all of the Lord’s arms are auspicious, whether they are holding conchshells and flowers or clubs and discs. The demons killed by Lord Viṣṇu’s <span class="Italic">cakra</span> disc and club are elevated to the spiritual world, just like the devotees who are protected by the hands holding the lotus flower and conchshell. However, the demons who are elevated to the spiritual world are situated in the impersonal Brahman effulgence, whereas the devotees are allowed to enter into the Vaikuṇṭha planets. Those who are devotees of Lord Kṛṣṇa are immediately elevated to the Goloka Vṛndāvana planet.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lord’s beauty is compared to rainfall because when the rain falls in the rainy season, it becomes more and more pleasing to the people. After the scorching heat of the summer season, the people enjoy the rainy season very much. Indeed, they even come out of their doors in the villages and enjoy the rainfall directly. Thus the Lord’s bodily features are compared to the clouds of the rainy season. The devotees enjoy the Lord’s beauty because it is a collection of all kinds of beauties. Therefore the word <span class="Italic">sarva-saundarya-saṅgraham</span> is used. No one can say that the body of the Lord is wanting in beautiful parts. It is completely <span class="Italic">pūrṇam.</span> Everything is complete: God’s creation, God’s beauty and God’s bodily features. All these are so complete that all one’s desires can become fully satisfied when one sees the beauty of the Lord. The word <span class="Italic">sarva-saundarya</span> indicates that there are different types of beauties in the material and spiritual worlds and that the Lord contains all of them. Both materialists and spiritualists can enjoy the beauty of the Lord. Because the Supreme Lord attracts everyone, including demons and devotees, materialists and spiritualists, He is called Kṛṣṇa. Similarly, His devotees also attract everyone. As mentioned in the <span class="Italic">Sad-gosvāmī-stotra:</span> <span class="Italic">dhīrādhīra-jana-priyau</span>—the Gosvāmīs are equally dear to the <span class="Italic">dhīra</span> (devotees) and <span class="Italic">adhīra</span> (demons). Lord Kṛṣṇa was not very pleasing to the demons when He was present in Vṛndāvana, but the six Gosvāmīs were pleasing to the demons when they were present in Vṛndāvana. That is the beauty of the Lord’s dealings with His devotees; sometimes the Lord gives more credit to His devotees than He takes for Himself. For instance, on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, Lord Kṛṣṇa fought simply by giving directions. Yet it was Arjuna who took the credit for fighting. <span class="Italic">Nimitta-mātraṁ bhava savyasācin:</span> “You, O Savyasācī [Arjuna], can be but an instrument in the fight.” (Bg. 11.33) Everything was arranged by the Lord, but the credit of victory was given to Arjuna. Similarly, in the Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement, everything is happening according to the predictions of Lord Caitanya, but the credit goes to Lord Caitanya’s sincere servants. Thus the Lord is described herein as <span class="Italic">sarva-saundarya-saṅgraham.</span>

            The Lord has shoulders just like a lion’s. Upon these shoulders are garlands, necklaces and epaulets, and all of these are always glittering. Besides these, there is the beauty of the Kaustubha-maṇi pearl, and on the dark chest of the Lord there are streaks named Śrīvatsa, which are signs of the goddess of fortune. The glittering of these streaks excels the beauty of the golden streaks on a gold-testing stone. Indeed, such beauty defeats a gold-testing stone.

            The whole universe is born out of the lotus stem which sprouted from the navel of the Lord. Lord Brahmā sat on the top of this lotus stem to create the whole universe. The navel of the Lord is so deep and coiling that it appears that the whole universe again wants to withdraw into the navel, being attracted by the Lord’s beauty. The Lord’s navel and the ripples on His belly always increase the beauty of His bodily features. The details of the bodily features of the Lord especially indicate the Personality of Godhead. Impersonalists cannot appreciate the beautiful body of the Lord, which is described in these prayers by Lord Śiva.

            My dear Lord, Your two lotus feet are so beautiful that they appear like two blossoming petals of the lotus flower which grows during the autumn season. Indeed, the nails of Your lotus feet emanate such a great effulgence that they immediately dissipate all the darkness in the heart of a conditioned soul. My dear Lord, kindly show me that form of Yours which always dissipates all kinds of darkness in the heart of a devotee.

            Lord Śiva has thus described the bodily features of the Lord authoritatively. Now he wants to see the lotus feet of the Lord. When a devotee wants to see the transcendental form of the Lord, he begins his meditation on the Lord’s body by first looking at the feet of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> is considered to be the transcendental sound form of the Lord, and the twelve cantos are divided in accordance with the transcendental form of the Lord. The First and Second Cantos of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> are called the two lotus feet of the Lord. It is therefore suggested by Lord Śiva that one should first try to see the lotus feet of the Lord. This also means that if one is serious about reading <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> he must begin by seriously studying the First and Second Cantos.
          </p>
          <p>
            The beauty of the lotus feet of the Lord is compared to the petals of a lotus flower which grows in the autumn season. By nature’s law, in autumn the dirty or muddy waters of rivers and lakes become very clean. At that time the lotus flowers growing in the lakes appear very bright and beautiful. The lotus flower itself is compared to the lotus feet of the Lord, and the petals are compared to the nails of the feet of the Lord. The nails of the feet of the Lord are very bright, as <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> testifies. <span class="Italic">Ānanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala-vigrahasya:</span> [Bs 5.32] every limb of the transcendental body of the Lord is made of <span class="Italic">ānanda-cinmaya-sad-ujjvala.</span> Thus every limb is eternally bright. As sunshine dissipates the darkness of this material world, the effulgence emanating from the body of the Lord immediately dries up the darkness in the heart of the conditioned soul. In other words, everyone serious about understanding the transcendental science and seeing the transcendental form of the Lord must first of all attempt to see the lotus feet of the Lord by studying the First and Second Cantos of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> When one sees the lotus feet of the Lord, all kinds of doubts and fears within the heart are vanquished.

            In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> it is said that in order to make spiritual progress, one must become fearless. <span class="Italic">Abhayaṁ sattva-saṁśuddhiḥ</span> (Bg. 16.1). Fearfulness is the result of material involvement. It is also said in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (11.2.37), <span class="Italic">bhayaṁ dvitīyābhiniveśataḥ syāt:</span> fearfulness is a creation of the bodily conception of life. As long as one is absorbed in the thought that he is this material body, he is fearful, and as soon as one is freed from this material conception, he becomes <span class="Italic">brahma-bhūta,</span> or self-realized, and immediately becomes fearless. <span class="Italic">Brahma-bhūtaḥ prasannātmā</span> (Bg. 18.54). Without being fearless, one cannot be joyful. The <span class="Italic">bhaktas,</span> the devotees, are fearless and always joyful because they are constantly engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord. It is also said:

            My dear Lord, those who desire to purify their existence must always engage in meditation upon Your lotus feet, as described above. Those who are serious about executing their occupational duties and who want freedom from fear must take to this process of bhakti-yoga.

            It is said that the transcendental name, form, pastimes and entourage of the Lord cannot be appreciated by the blunt material senses; therefore one has to engage himself in devotional service so that the senses may be purified and one can see the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here, however, it is indicated that those who are constantly engaged in meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord are certainly purified of the material contamination of the senses and are thus able to see the Supreme Lord face to face. The word “meditation” is very popular in this age amongst the common people, but they do not know the actual meaning of meditation. However, from Vedic literature we learn that the <span class="Italic">yogīs</span> are always absorbed in meditation upon the lotus feet of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Dhyānāvasthita-tad-gatena manasā paśyanti yaṁ yoginaḥ</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 12.13.1). This is the real business of the <span class="Italic">yogīs:</span> to think of the lotus feet of the Lord. Lord Śiva therefore advises that one who is actually serious about purification must engage himself in this type of meditation or in the mystic <span class="Italic">yoga</span> system, which will help him not only to see the Lord within constantly but to see Him face to face and become His associate in Vaikuṇṭhaloka or Goloka Vṛndāvana.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word <span class="Italic">sva-dharmam</span> (as in <span class="Italic">sva-dharmam anutiṣṭhatām</span>) indicates that the system of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama</span>—which indicates the occupational duties of the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</span> and <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> and which is the perfect institution for humanity—must be supported by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> if one at all wants security in life. Generally people think that simply by executing the occupational duties of a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa, kṣatriya, vaiśya</span> or <span class="Italic">śūdra</span> or the duty of a <span class="Italic">brahmacārī, gṛhastha, vānaprastha</span> or <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> one becomes fearless or securely attains liberation, but factually unless all these occupational duties are accompanied by <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> one cannot become fearless. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> there are descriptions of <span class="Italic">karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga, bhakti-yoga, dhyāna-yoga,</span> etc., but unless one comes to the point of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> these other <span class="Italic">yogas</span> cannot help one attain the highest perfection of life. In other words, <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> is the only means for liberation. We find this conclusion also in <span class="Italic">Caitanya-caritāmṛta</span> in a discussion between Lord Caitanya and Rāmānanda Rāya regarding a human being’s liberation from this material world. In that discussion Rāmānanda Rāya referred to the execution of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma,</span> and Lord Caitanya indicated that the <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> was simply external (<span class="Italic">eho bāhya</span>). Lord Caitanya wanted to impress upon Rāmānanda Rāya that simply by executing the duties of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> one is not guaranteed liberation. Finally Rāmānanda Rāya referred to the process of <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga:</span> <span class="Italic">sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 10.14.3). Regardless of one’s condition of life, if he practices <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> which begins with hearing (<span class="Italic">śruti-gatām</span>) the transcendental messages of the Lord through the mouths of devotees, he gradually conquers the unconquerable God.
          </p>
          <p>
            God is known to be unconquerable, but one who submissively hears the words of a self-realized soul conquers the unconquerable. The conclusion is that if one is serious about liberation, he not only should execute the occupational duties of <span class="Italic">varṇāśrama-dharma</span> but should also engage in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> by beginning hearing from a realized soul. This process will help the devotee conquer the unconquerable Supreme Personality of Godhead and become His associate after giving up the material body.

Those who are <span class="Italic">bhakti-yogīs,</span> however, have no difficulty at all. In the word <span class="Italic">svārājyasya, svar</span> refers to Svargaloka, the heavenly planet, and <span class="Italic">svārājya</span> refers to the ruler of the heavenly planet, Indra. Generally, <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> desire elevation to heavenly planets, but King Indra desires to become perfect in <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> Those who identify themselves as <span class="Italic"> (“I am the Supreme Brahman, one with the Absolute Truth”) also ultimately desire to attain perfect liberation in the Vaikuṇṭha planets or Goloka Vṛndāvana. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (18.55) it is said:</span>

            In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.34) it is said that the Lord in the shape and form of death destroys all a person’s possessions. <span class="Italic">Mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham:</span> “I am all-devouring death.” The Lord in the shape of death takes away everything that is created by the conditioned soul. Everything in this material world is subject to perish in due course of time. However, all the strength of time cannot hamper the activities of a devotee, for a devotee takes complete shelter under the lotus feet of the Lord. For this reason only is a devotee free from formidable time. All the activities of the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> and <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> which have no touch of devotional service, are spoiled in due course of time. The material success of the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> is destined to be destroyed; similarly, the impersonal realization attained by the <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> is also destroyed in the course of time.

Unless one is fully situated in unalloyed devotional service, there is no guarantee of liberation, even if one is elevated to the heavenly planets or to the impersonal Brahman effulgence. A devotee’s achievement, however, is never lost by the influence of time. Even if a devotee cannot completely execute devotional service, in his next life he begins from the point where he left off. Such an opportunity is not given to the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> and <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> whose achievements are destroyed. The <span class="Italic">bhakta’s</span> achievement is never destroyed, for it goes on perpetually, be it complete or incomplete.

            When Yamarāja, the superintendent of death, was instructing his assistants, he told them not to approach the devotees. “The devotees should be offered respect,” he said, “but do not go near them.” Thus the devotees of the Lord are not under the jurisdiction of Yamarāja. Yamarāja is a representative of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he controls the death of every living entity. Yet he has nothing to do with the devotees. Simply by blinking his eyes, time personified can destroy the entire cosmic manifestation, but he has nothing to do with the devotee. In other words, devotional service which is rendered by the devotee in this lifetime can never be destroyed by time. Such spiritual assets remain unchanged, being beyond the influence of time.

            Out of three kinds of men—the <span class="Italic">karmīs, jñānīs</span> and <span class="Italic">bhaktas</span>—the <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> is described herein as the most exalted. Śrīla Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī has sung: <span class="Italic">kaivalyaṁ narakāyate tridaśa-pūr ākāśa-puṣpāyate</span> (<span class="Italic">Caitanya-candrāmṛta</span>). The word <span class="Italic">kaivalya</span> means to merge into the effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and the word <span class="Italic">tridaśa-pūr</span> refers to the heavenly planets where the demigods live. Thus for a devotee, <span class="Italic">kaivalya-sukha,</span> or merging into the existence of the Lord, is hellish because the <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> considers it suicidal to lose his individuality and merge into the effulgence of Brahman. A <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> always wants to retain his individuality in order to render service to the Lord. Indeed, he considers promotion to the upper planetary systems to be no better than a will-o’-the-wisp. Temporary, material happiness holds no value for a devotee. The devotee is in such an exalted position that he is not interested in the actions of <span class="Italic">karma</span> or <span class="Italic">jñāna.</span> The resultant actions of <span class="Italic">karma</span> and <span class="Italic">jñāna</span> are so insignificant to a devotee situated on the transcendental platform that he is not in the least interested in them. <span class="Italic">Bhakti-yoga</span> is sufficient to give the <span class="Italic">bhakta</span> all happiness. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (1.2.6): <span class="Italic">yayātmā suprasīdati.</span> One can be fully satisfied simply by devotional service, and that is the result of association with a devotee. Without being blessed by a pure devotee, no one can be fully satisfied, nor can anyone understand the transcendental position of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            The Ganges water is celebrated as being able to eradicate all kinds of sinful reactions. In other words, when a person takes his bath in the Ganges, he becomes freed from all life’s contaminations. The Ganges water is celebrated in this way because it emanates from the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Similarly, those who are directly in touch with the lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and who are absorbed in the chanting of His glories are freed from all material contamination. Such unalloyed devotees are able to show mercy to the common conditioned soul. Śrīla Vṛndāvana dāsa Ṭhākura has sung that the devotees of Lord Caitanya are so powerful that each one of them can deliver a universe. In other words, it is the business of devotees to preach the glories of the Lord and deliver all conditioned souls to the platform of <span class="Italic">śuddha-sattva,</span> pure goodness.

          <p>
            Simply by associating with a pure devotee, one becomes wonderfully advanced in Kṛṣṇa consciousness. <span class="Italic">Sādhu-saṅga,</span> or association with a devotee, means always engaging in Kṛṣṇa consciousness by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> and by acting for Kṛṣṇa. Specifically, chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra</span> purifies one, and this chanting is therefore recommended by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu. <span class="Italic">Ceto-darpaṇa-mārjanam: [Cc. Antya 20.12]</span> by chanting the names of Kṛṣṇa, the mirror of the heart is cleansed, and the devotee loses interest in everything external. When one is influenced by the external energy of the Lord, his heart is impure. When one’s heart is not pure, he cannot see how things are related to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Idaṁ hi viśvaṁ bhagavān ivetaraḥ</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 1.5.20). He whose heart is purified can see that the whole cosmic manifestation is but the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but he whose heart is contaminated sees things differently. Therefore by <span class="Italic">sat-saṅga,</span> or association with devotees, one becomes perfectly pure in heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            One who is pure in heart is never attracted by the external energy, which urges the individual soul to try to dominate material nature. The pure heart of a devotee is never disturbed when he executes devotional service in the form of hearing, chanting, remembering, etc. In all, there are nine processes one can follow in the execution of devotional service. In any case, a pure-hearted devotee is never disturbed. The <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga</span> process must be carried out by avoiding the ten offenses one can commit while chanting the <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> and the sixty-four offenses one can commit while worshiping the Deity. When a devotee strictly follows the rules and regulations, Bhaktidevī becomes very much satisfied with him, and at that time he is never disturbed by anything external. A devotee is also called a <span class="Italic">muni.</span> The word <span class="Italic">muni</span> means “thoughtful.” A devotee is as thoughtful as a nondevotee is speculative. The nondevotee’s speculation is impure, but a devotee’s thoughts are pure. Lord Kapila and Śukadeva Gosvāmī are also called <span class="Italic">muni,</span> and Vyāsadeva is addressed as Mahāmuni. A devotee is addressed as <span class="Italic">muni,</span> or thoughtful, when he purely understands the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The conclusion is that when one’s heart is purified by the association of devotees and by the avoidance of the offenses committed when chanting and worshiping the Lord, the transcendental name, form and activities of the Lord are revealed by the Lord.

            My dear Lord, the impersonal Brahman spreads everywhere, like the sunshine or the sky. And that impersonal Brahman, which spreads throughout the universe and in which the entire universe is manifested, is You.

        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_60_purport">
          <p>
            In Vedic literature it is said that everything is Brahman and nothing else. The whole cosmic manifestation rests on the Brahman effulgence. The impersonalists, however, cannot understand how such a huge cosmic manifestation can rest on a person. Thus this inconceivable power of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is not understood by the impersonalists; therefore they are puzzled and always denying that the Absolute Truth is a person. This wrong impression is cleared by Lord Śiva himself, who says that the impersonal Brahman, which is spread all over the universe, is nothing but the Supreme Lord Himself. Here it is clearly said that the Lord is spread everywhere, just like the sunshine, by virtue of His Brahman feature. This example is very easy to understand. All the planetary systems are resting upon the sunshine, yet the sunshine and the source of sunshine are aloof from the planetary manifestations. Similarly, the sky or air is spread everywhere; air is within a pot, but it also touches filthy places and sanctified places alike. In any case, the sky is uncontaminated. The sunshine also touches filthy places and sanctified places, and both are actually produced by the sun, but in any case the sun is aloof from all filthy things. Similarly, the Lord exists everywhere. There are pious things and impious things, but in the <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> the pious things are described as the front of the Supreme Lord, whereas impious things are described as the back of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.4) the Lord clearly says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">mayā tatam idaṁ sarvaṁ<br>jagad avyakta-mūrtinā<br>mat-sthāni sarva-bhūtāni<br>na cāhaṁ teṣv avasthitaḥ</div>

            “By Me, in My unmanifested form, this entire universe is pervaded. All beings are in Me, but I am not in them.”
          </p>
          <p>
            This verse of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> explains that the Lord is spread everywhere by virtue of His Brahman feature. Everything rests in Him, yet He is not there. The conclusion is that without <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga,</span> without rendering devotional service to the Lord, even an impersonalist cannot understand the <span class="Italic">brahma-tattva,</span> the Brahman feature. In the <span class="Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> it is stated: <span class="Italic">athāto brahma jijñāsā.</span> This means that Brahman, Paramātmā or Parabrahman should be understood. In <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> also the Absolute Truth is described as the one without a second, but He is realized in three features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the ultimate issue, and in this verse Lord Śiva confirms that ultimately the Absolute Truth is a person. He clearly says: <span class="Italic">tat tvaṁ brahma paraṁ jyotir ākāśam iva vistṛtam.</span> Here is a common example: a successful businessman may have many factories and offices, and everything rests on his order. If someone says that the entire business rests on such-and-such a person, it does not mean that the person is bearing all the factories and offices on his head. Rather, it is understood that by his brain or his energetic expansion, the business is running without interruption. Similarly, it is the brain and energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead that carry on the complete manifestation of the material and spiritual worlds. The philosophy of monism, explained here very clearly, adjusts itself to the fact that the supreme source of all energy is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. This is described very clearly. It is also stated how the impersonal feature of Kṛṣṇa can be understood:
          </p>

          </p>
          <p>
            In this way Kṛṣṇa can be understood as the mystic power in everything.

            My dear Lord, You have manifold energies, and these energies are manifested in manifold forms. With such energies You have also created this cosmic manifestation, and although You maintain it as if it were permanent, You ultimately annihilate it. Although You are never disturbed by such changes and alterations, the living entities are disturbed by them, and therefore they find the cosmic manifestation to be different or separated from You. My Lord, You are always independent, and I can clearly see this fact.

            It is clearly explained that Lord Kṛṣṇa has multienergies, which can be grouped into three: namely the external energy, the internal energy and the marginal energy. There are also different cosmic manifestations—namely the spiritual world and the material world—as well as different types of living entities. Some living entities are conditioned, and others are eternally free. The eternally free living entities are called <span class="Italic">nitya-mukta,</span> for they never come in contact with the material energy. However, some living entities are conditioned in this material world, and thus they think themselves separated from the Supreme Lord. Due to their contact with the material energy, their existence is always troublesome. Being always in distress, the conditioned soul considers the material energy to be very much disturbing. This fact is explained by a Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">kavi,</span> or poet:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">kṛṣṇa bhuli’ sei jīva anādi-bahirmukha<br>ataeva māyā tāre deya saṁsāra-duḥkha</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            When the living entity forgets the Supreme Lord and wants to enjoy himself independently, imitating the Supreme Lord, he is captured by the false notion that he is the enjoyer and is separated from the Supreme Lord. This material energy is therefore very much troublesome to the spiritual energy, the living entity, but the material energy is never troublesome to the Supreme Lord. Indeed, for the Supreme Lord, both material and spiritual energy are the same. In this verse Lord Śiva explains that the material energy is never troublesome to the Supreme Lord. The Supreme Lord is always independent, but because the living entities are not independent—due to their false idea of becoming independently happy—the material energy is troublesome. Consequently the material energy creates differentiation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because the Māyāvādī philosophers cannot understand this, they want to be relieved from the material energy. However, because a Vaiṣṇava philosopher is in full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he finds no disturbance even in the material energy. This is because he knows how to utilize the material energy for the service of the Lord. In the government, the criminal department and civil department may appear different in the eyes of the citizens, but in the eyes of the government both departments are one and the same. The criminal department is troublesome for the criminal but not for the obedient citizen. Similarly, this material energy is troublesome for the conditioned soul, but it has nothing to do with the liberated souls who are engaged in the service of the Lord. Through the <span class="Italic">puruṣa-avatāra</span> Mahā-Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead created the whole cosmic manifestation. Simply by breathing out all the universes, the Lord creates and maintains the cosmic manifestation as Lord Viṣṇu. Then as Saṅkarṣaṇa, He annihilates the cosmic manifestation. Yet despite the creation, maintenance and destruction of the cosmos, the Lord is not affected. The various activities of the Lord must be very disturbing to the tiny living entities, but since the Lord is supremely great, He is never affected. Lord Śiva or any other pure devotee can see this clearly without being blinded by <span class="Italic">bheda-buddhi,</span> or differentiation. For a devotee, the Lord is the supreme spirit soul. Since He is supremely powerful, His various powers are also spiritual. For a devotee, there is nothing material, for material existence only means forgetfulness of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            In a previous verse Lord Śiva wanted to see the form of the Lord which the devotees are always interested in. There are other forms of the Lord manifest in the material world, including Brahmā and other demigods, and these are worshiped by materialistic persons. In the Second Canto, Third Chapter, of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> it is stated that those who desire material benefits are recommended to worship different types of demigods, and in conclusion the <span class="Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> recommends:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

          </p>
          <p>
            (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 2.3.10)
          </p>
          <p>
            The devotees, the <span class="Italic">jñānīs,</span> who are known as <span class="Italic">mokṣa-kāma,</span> and the <span class="Italic">karmīs,</span> who are known as <span class="Italic">sarva-kāma,</span> are all aspiring to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu. Even when one performs <span class="Italic">yajñas,</span> as stated here (<span class="Italic">kriyā-kalāpaiḥ</span>), he should always remember that the demigods are but agents of the Supreme Lord. Actually the worshipful Lord is Viṣṇu, Yajñeśvara. Thus even when different demigods are worshiped in the Vedic and Tantric sacrifices, the actual goal of sacrifice is Lord Viṣṇu. Therefore in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.23) it is said:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">ye ’py anya-devatā-bhaktā<br>yajante śraddhayānvitāḥ<br>te ’pi mām eva kaunteya<br>yajanty avidhi-pūrvakam</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Whatever a man may sacrifice to other gods, O son of Kuntī, is really meant for Me alone, but is offered without true understanding.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus the worshipers of various demigods also worship the Supreme Lord, but they do so against the regulative principles. The purpose of the regulative principles is to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu. In the <span class="Ref_Italic">Viṣṇu Purāṇa</span> (3.8.9) the very same thing is confirmed:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">varṇāśramācāravatā<br>puruṣeṇa paraḥ pumān<br>viṣṇur ārādhyate panthā<br>nānyat tat-toṣa-kāraṇam</div>

            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here it is clearly mentioned that the <span class="Italic">karmī, jñānī</span> or <span class="Italic">yogī</span>—in fact, everyone—worships Lord Viṣṇu if he is actually expert in knowledge of the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> and <span class="Italic">Tantras.</span> The word <span class="Italic">kovidāḥ</span> is very significant, for it indicates the devotees of the Lord. Only the devotees know perfectly that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Viṣṇu, is all-pervading. Within the material energy, He is represented by the five material elements as well as the mind, intelligence and ego. He is also represented by another energy—the living entities—and all these manifestations in the spiritual and material world combined are but representations of the different energies of the Lord. The conclusion is that the Lord is one and that He is expanded in everything. This is understood by the Vedic version: <span class="Italic">sarvaṁ khalv idaṁ brahma.</span> One who knows this concentrates all his energy in worshiping Lord Viṣṇu.

            My dear Lord, You are the only Supreme Person, the cause of all causes. Before the creation of this material world, Your material energy remains in a dormant condition. When Your material energy is agitated, the three qualities—namely goodness, passion and ignorance—act, and as a result the total material energy—egotism, ether, air, fire, water, earth and all the various demigods and saintly persons—becomes manifest. Thus the material world is created.

            If the whole creation is one—that is, nothing but the Supreme Lord, or Viṣṇu—then why do the expert transcendentalists make such categories as are found in the above verse:? Why do learned and expert scholars distinguish between matter and spirit? In answer to these questions, Lord Śiva says that spirit and matter are not creations of various philosophers, but are manifested by Lord Viṣṇu, as described in this verse: <span class="Italic">tvam eka ādyaḥ puruṣaḥ.</span> Spiritual and material categories are made possible by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but actually there are no such distinctions for the living entities who are eternally engaged in the service of the Lord. There is only a material world for those who want to imitate the Lord and become enjoyers. Indeed, the material world is nothing but forgetfulness of the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, the creator of everything. The distinction between matter and spirit is created by the sleeping energy of the Lord when the Lord wants to give some facility to those living entities who want to imitate the Lord in His enjoyment. It is only for them that this material world is created by the dormant energy of the Lord. For instance, sometimes children want to imitate their mother and cook in the kitchen, and at such a time the mother supplies them with some toys so that the children can imitate her cooking. Similarly, when some of the living entities want to imitate the activities of the Lord, this material cosmic manifestation is created for them by the Lord. The material creation is therefore caused by the Lord through His material energy. It is by the glance of the Lord that the material energy is activated. At that time the three material qualities are set into motion, and the material energy is manifested first in the form of the <span class="Italic">mahat-tattva,</span> then egotism, then ether, then air, fire, water and earth. After the creation, the living entities are impregnated in the cosmic manifestation, and they emerge as Lord Brahmā and the seven great <span class="Italic">ṛṣis,</span> then as different demigods. From the demigods come human beings, animals, trees, birds, beasts and everything else. The original cause, however, is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, as verified herein—<span class="Italic">tvam eka ādyaḥ puruṣaḥ.</span> This is also confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> (5.1):
          </p>

            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            Those who are covered by the material energy cannot understand that the origin of everything is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. This is summarized in the <span class="Italic">Vedānta</span> aphorism <span class="Italic">janmādy asya yataḥ [SB 1.1.1]</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Vedānta-sūtra</span> 1.1.2). Kṛṣṇa also confirms this in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.8):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

          <p>
            “I am the source of all spiritual and material worlds. Everything emanates from Me. The wise who know this perfectly engage in My devotional service and worship Me with all their hearts.”
          </p>
          <p>
            When Kṛṣṇa says that He is the origin of everything (<span class="Italic">ahaṁ sarvasya prabhavaḥ</span>), He means that He is even the source of Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, the <span class="Italic">puruṣa-avatāras,</span> the material manifestation and all the living entities within the material world. Actually the word <span class="Italic">prabhava</span> (“creation”) only refers to this material world, for since the spiritual world is eternally existing, there is no question of creation. In the <span class="Italic">Catuḥ-ślokī</span> of <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam,</span> the Lord says, <span class="Italic">aham evāsam evāgre:</span> “I was existing in the beginning before the creation.” (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 2.9.33) In the <span class="Italic">Vedas</span> it is also said, <span class="Italic">eko nārāyaṇa āsīt:</span> “Before the creation there was only Nārāyaṇa.” This is also confirmed by Śaṅkarācārya. <span class="Italic">Nārāyaṇaḥ paro ’vyaktāt:</span> “Nārāyaṇa is transcendental to the creation.” (<span class="Italic">Gīta—bhāṣya</span>) Since all the activities of Nārāyaṇa are spiritual, when Nārāyaṇa said, “Let there be creation,” that creation was all-spiritual. The “material” only exists for those who have forgotten that Nārāyaṇa is the original cause.

            My dear Lord, after creating by Your own potencies, You enter within the creation in four kinds of forms.

            The material cosmic manifestation is an exhibition of the external energy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but because dull matter cannot work independently, the Lord Himself enters within this material creation in the form of a partial expansion (Paramātmā), and He enters also by His separated parts and parcels (the living entities). In other words, both the living entities and the Supreme Personality of Godhead enter into the material creation just to make it active. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.5):
          </p>

            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

          </p>
          <p>
            Since the material world cannot work independently, the living entities enter into the material manifestation in four different types of bodies. The word <span class="Italic">catur-vidham</span> is significant in this verse. There are four types of living entities born within this material world. Some are born by way of an embryo (<span class="Italic">jarāyu ja</span>), by way of eggs (<span class="Italic">aṇḍa ja</span>), perspiration (<span class="Italic">sveda ja</span>) and, like the trees, by way of seeds (<span class="Italic">udbhijja</span>). Regardless of how these living entities appear, they are all busy in the pursuit of sense enjoyment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The materialistic scientists’ contention that living entities other than human beings have no soul is nullified herein. Whether they are born through an embryo, eggs, perspiration or seeds, all living entities in the 8,400,000 species of life are parts and parcels of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and each therefore is an individual spiritual spark and soul. The Supreme Personality of Godhead also remains within the heart of the living entity, regardless of whether the living entity is a man, animal, tree, germ or microbe. The Lord resides in everyone’s heart, and because all living entities who come to this material world do so in order to fulfill their desire for sense enjoyment, the Lord directs the living entities to enjoy their senses. Thus the Paramātmā, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, knows everyone’s desires. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (15.15):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">sarvasya cāhaṁ hṛdi sanniviṣṭo<br>mattaḥ smṛtir jñānam apohanaṁ ca</div>

            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Remaining within the hearts of all living entities, the Lord bestows remembrance by which the living entities can enjoy certain things. Thus the living entities create their enjoyable honeycombs and then enjoy them. The example of the bees is appropriate because when bees try to enjoy their honeycomb, they have to suffer the bites of other bees. Because bees bite one another when they enjoy honey, they are not exclusively enjoying the sweetness of the honey, for there is also suffering. In other words, the living entities are subjected to the pains and pleasures of material enjoyment, whereas the Supreme Personality of Godhead, knowing their plans for sense enjoyment, is aloof from them. In the <span class="Italic">Upaniṣads</span> the example is given of two birds sitting on a tree. One bird (the <span class="Italic">jīva,</span> or living entity) is enjoying the fruits of that tree, and the other bird (Paramātmā) is simply witnessing. In the <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (13.23) the Supreme Personality of Godhead as Paramātmā is described as <span class="Italic">upadraṣṭā</span> (the overseer) and <span class="Italic">anumantā</span> (the permitter).
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus the Lord simply witnesses and gives the living entity sanction for sense enjoyment. It is the Paramātmā also who gives the intelligence by which the bees can construct a hive, collect honey from various flowers, store it and enjoy it. Although the Paramātmā is aloof from the living entities, He knows their intentions, and He gives them facilities by which they can enjoy or suffer the results of their actions. Human society is exactly like a beehive, for everyone is engaged in collecting honey from various flowers, or collecting money from various sources, and creating large empires for common enjoyment. However, after these empires are created, the bites of other nations have to be suffered. Sometimes nations declare war upon one another, and the human beehives become sources of misery. Although human beings are creating their beehives in order to enjoy the sweetness of their senses, they are at the same time suffering from the bites of other persons or nations. The Supreme Personality of Godhead as Paramātmā is simply witnessing all these activities. The conclusion is that both the Supreme Personality of Godhead and the <span class="Italic">jīvas</span> enter into this material world. However, the Paramātmā, or Supreme Personality of Godhead, is worshipable because He has arranged for the happiness of the living entity in the material world. Because it is the material world, however, no one can enjoy any kind of happiness without inebriety. Material enjoyment means inebriety, whereas spiritual enjoyment means pure enjoyment under the protection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            My dear Lord, Your absolute authority cannot be directly experienced, but one can guess by seeing the activities of the world that everything is being destroyed in due course of time. The force of time is very strong, and everything is being destroyed by something else—just as one animal is being eaten by another animal. Time scatters everything, exactly as the wind scatters clouds in the sky.

            The process of destruction is going on according to the law of nature. Nothing within this material world can be permanent, although scientists, philosophers, workers and everyone else are trying to make things permanent. One foolish scientist recently declared that eventually life will be made permanent through science. Some so-called scientists are also trying to manufacture living entities within the laboratory. Thus in one way or another everyone is busy denying the existence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and rejecting the supreme authority of the Lord. However, the Lord is so powerful that He destroys everything in the form of death. As Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (10.34), <span class="Italic">mṛtyuḥ sarva-haraś cāham:</span> “I am all-devouring death.” The Lord is just like death to the atheists, for He takes away everything they accumulate in the material world. Hiraṇyakaśipu, the father of Prahlāda, always denied the existence of the Lord, and he tried to kill his five-year-old boy due to the boy’s unflinching faith in God. However, in due course of time the Lord appeared as Nṛsiṁhadeva and killed Hiraṇyakaśipu in the presence of his son. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (1.13.47), this killing process is natural. <span class="Italic">Jīvo jīvasya jīvanam:</span> “one animal is food for another animal.” A frog is eaten by a snake, a snake is eaten by a mongoose, and the mongoose is eaten by another animal. In this way the process of destruction goes on by the supreme will of the Lord. Although we do not see the hand of the Supreme Lord directly, we can feel the presence of that hand through the Lord’s process of destruction. We can see the clouds scattered by the wind, although we cannot see how this is being done because it is not possible to see the wind. Similarly, although we do not directly see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we can see that He controls the process of destruction. The destructive process is going on fiercely under the control of the Lord, but the atheists cannot see it.

            My dear Lord, all living entities within this material world are mad after planning for things, and they are always busy with a desire to do this or that. This is due to uncontrollable greed. The greed for material enjoyment is always existing in the living entity, but Your Lordship is always alert, and in due course of time You strike him, just as a snake seizes a mouse and very easily swallows him.

            Everyone is greedy, and everyone makes plans for material enjoyment. In his lust for material enjoyment, the living entity is described as a madman. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (3.27):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">prakṛteḥ kriyamāṇāni<br>guṇaiḥ karmāṇi sarvaśaḥ<br>ahaṅkāra-vimūḍhātmā<br>kartāham iti manyate</div>

            “The bewildered spirit soul, under the influence of the three modes of material nature, thinks himself to be the doer of activities which are in actuality carried out by nature.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything is enacted by the laws of nature, and these laws are under the direction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The atheists, or unintelligent men, do not know this. They are busy making their own plans, and big nations are busy expanding their empires. And yet we know that in due course of time many empires have come into existence and been destroyed. Many aristocratic families were created by people in their extreme madness, but we can see that in the course of time those families and empires have all been destroyed. But still the foolish atheists do not accept the supreme authority of the Lord. Such foolish people unnecessarily concoct their own duties without referring to the supreme authority of the Lord. The so-called political leaders are busy making plans to advance the material prosperity of their nation, but factually these political leaders only want an exalted position for themselves. Due to their greed for material position, they falsely present themselves as leaders before the people and collect their votes, although they are completely under the grip of the laws of material nature. These are some of the faults of modern civilization. Without taking to God consciousness and accepting the authority of the Lord, the living entities become ultimately confused and frustrated in their planmaking attempts. Due to their unauthorized plans for economic development, the price of commodities is rising daily all over the world, so much so that is has become difficult for the poorer classes, and they are suffering the consequences. And due to lack of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, people are being fooled by so-called leaders and planmakers. Consequently, the sufferings of the people are increasing. According to the laws of nature, which are backed by the Lord, nothing can be permanent within this material world; therefore everyone should be allowed to take shelter of the Absolute in order to be saved. In this regard, Lord Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (5.29):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ<br>sarva-loka-maheśvaram<br>suhṛdaṁ sarva-bhūtānāṁ<br>jñātvā māṁ śāntim ṛcchati</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “The sages, knowing Me as the ultimate purpose of all sacrifices and austerities, the Supreme Lord of all planets and demigods and the benefactor and well-wisher of all living entities, attain peace from the pangs of material miseries.”
          </p>
          <p>
            If one wants peace of mind and tranquillity in society, he must accept the fact that the real enjoyer is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Lord is the proprietor of everything all over the universe, and He is the supreme friend of all living entities as well. By understanding this, people can become happy and peaceful individually and collectively.

            My dear Lord, any learned person knows that unless he worships You, his entire life is spoiled. Knowing this, how could he give up worshiping Your lotus feet? Even our father and spiritual master, Lord Brahmā, unhesitatingly worshiped You, and the fourteen Manus followed in his footsteps.

            The word <span class="Italic">paṇḍita</span> means “a wise man.” Who is actually a wise man? The wise man is described in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.19) in this way:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">bahūnāṁ janmanām ante<br>jñānavān māṁ prapadyate<br>vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti<br>sa mahātmā sudurlabhaḥ</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge surrenders unto Me, knowing Me to be the cause of all causes and all that is. Such a great soul is very rare.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus when the wise man actually becomes wise after many births and whimsical attempts at self-realization, he surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kṛṣṇa. Such a <span class="Italic">mahātmā,</span> or learned person, knows that Kṛṣṇa, Vāsudeva, is everything (<span class="Italic">vāsudevaḥ sarvam iti [Bg. </span>7.19]). Learned persons always think that life is wasted unless they worship Lord Kṛṣṇa or become His devotee. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī also says that when one becomes an advanced devotee, he understands that he should be reserved and perseverant (<span class="Italic">kṣāntiḥ</span>) and that he should engage in the service of the Lord and not waste time (<span class="Italic">avyartha-kālatvam [Cc.</span>Madhya 23.18-19]). He should also be detached from all material attraction (<span class="Italic">viraktiḥ</span>), and he should not long for any material respect in return for his activities (<span class="Italic">māna-śūnyatā</span>). He should be certain that Kṛṣṇa will bestow His mercy upon him (<span class="Italic">āśā-bandhaḥ</span>), and he should always be very eager to serve the Lord faithfully (<span class="Italic">samutkaṇṭhā</span>). The wise man is always very eager to glorify the Lord by chanting and hearing (<span class="Italic">nāma-gāne sadā ruciḥ</span>), and he is always eager to describe the transcendental qualities of the Lord (<span class="Italic">āsaktis tad-guṇākhyāne</span>). He should also be attracted to those places where the Lord had His pastimes (<span class="Italic">prītis tad-vasati-sthalePrītis tad vasati sthāle</span>). These are symptoms of an advanced devotee.
          </p>
          <p>
            An advanced devotee, or a perfect human being who is actually wise and learned, cannot give up his service at the lotus feet of the Lord. Although Lord Brahmā has a long life-span (4,320,000,000 years constitute twelve hours in a day of Brahmā), Brahmā is afraid of death and consequently engages in the devotional service of the Lord. Similarly, all the Manus who appear and disappear during the day of Brahmā are also engaged in the Lord’s devotional service. In Brahmā’s one day, fourteen Manus appear and disappear. The first Manu is Svāyambhuva Manu. Each Manu lives for seventy-one <span class="Italic">yugas,</span> each consisting of some 4,320,000 years. Although the Manus have such a long life-span, they still prepare for the next life by engaging in the devotional service of the Lord. In this age human beings only live for sixty or eighty years, and even this small life-span is gradually decreasing. Therefore it is even more imperative for human beings to take to the worship of the lotus feet of the Lord by constantly chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> as recommended by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu.

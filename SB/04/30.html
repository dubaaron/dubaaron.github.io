            Vidura inquired from Maitreya: O brāhmaṇa, you formerly spoke about the sons of Prācīnabarhi and informed me that they satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead by chanting a song composed by Lord Śiva. What did they achieve in this way?
          </p>

            In the beginning, Maitreya Ṛṣi narrated the activities of the sons of Prācīnabarhi. These sons went beside a great lake, which was like an ocean, and fortunately finding Lord Śiva, they learned how to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead by chanting the songs composed by Lord Śiva. Now their father’s attachment for fruitive activities was disapproved by Nārada, who therefore kindly instructed Prācīnabarhi by telling him the allegorical story of Purañjana. Now Vidura again wanted to hear about Prācīnabarhi’s sons, and he was especially inquisitive to know what they achieved by satisfying the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Here the words <span class="Italic">siddhim āpuḥ,</span> or “achieved perfection,” are very important. Lord Kṛṣṇa says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.3), <span class="Italic">manuṣyāṇāṁ sahasreṣu kaścid yatati siddhaye:</span> out of many, many millions of people, one may be interested in learning how to attain success in spiritual matters. The supreme success is mentioned also in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (8.15):
          </p>

            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            “After attaining Me, the great souls, who are <span class="Italic">yogīs</span> in devotion, never return to this temporary world, which is full of miseries, because they have attained the highest perfection.” And what is that highest perfection? That is also explained in that verse. The highest perfection is to return home, back to Godhead, so that one will not have to return to this material world and transmigrate from one body to another in the dream of material existence. By the grace of Lord Śiva, the Pracetās actually attained perfection and returned home, back to Godhead, after enjoying material facilities to the highest extent. Maitreya will now narrate that to Vidura.

            My dear Bārhaspatya, what did the sons of King Barhiṣat, known as the Pracetās, obtain after meeting Lord Śiva, who is very dear to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the bestower of liberation? Certainly they were transferred to the spiritual world, but apart from that, what did they obtain within this material world, either in this life or in other lives?

            All types of material happiness are obtained in this life or in the next life, on this planet or on another. The living entity wanders within this material universe in so many species of life and so many planetary systems. The distress and happiness obtained during the span of life are called <span class="Italic">iha,</span> and the distress and happiness obtained in the next life are called <span class="Italic">paratra.</span>

            Actually, Lord Mahādeva (Śiva) is one of the great demigods within this material world. Generally his blessings bestowed on ordinary people mean material happiness. The predominating deity of this material world, Durgā, is under the control of Lord Mahādeva, Giriśa. Thus Lord Mahādeva can offer anyone any kind of material happiness. Generally people prefer to become devotees of Lord Giriśa to obtain material happiness, but the Pracetās met Lord Mahādeva by providential arrangement. Lord Mahādeva instructed them to worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he personally offered a prayer. As stated in the previous verse (<span class="Italic">rudra-gītena</span>), simply by chanting the prayers offered by Lord Śiva to Viṣṇu, the Pracetās were transferred to the spiritual world. Sometimes devotees desire to enjoy material happiness also; therefore, by the arrangement of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the devotee is given a chance to enjoy the material world before his final entrance into the spiritual world. Sometimes a devotee is transferred to a heavenly planet—to Janaloka, Maharloka, Tapoloka, Siddhaloka and so on. However, a pure devotee never aspires for any kind of material happiness. The pure devotee is consequently transferred directly to Vaikuṇṭhaloka, which is described here as <span class="Italic">param.</span> In this verse Vidura asks Maitreya, the disciple of Bṛhaspati, about the different achievements of the Pracetās.

            The great sage Maitreya said: The sons of King Prācīnabarhi, known as the Pracetās, underwent severe austerities within the seawater to carry out the order of their father. By chanting and repeating the mantras given by Lord Śiva, they were able to satisfy Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            One can offer prayers to the Supreme Personality of Godhead directly, but if one repeats the prayers offered by great devotees like Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā, or if one follows in the footsteps of great personalities, one can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead very easily. For instance, we sometimes chant this <span class="Italic">mantra</span> of <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> (5.29):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            “I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, the first progenitor, who is tending the cows, yielding all desires, in abodes built with spiritual gems and surrounded by millions of purpose trees. He is always served with great reverence and affection by hundreds of thousands of <span class="Italic">lakṣmīs,</span> or <span class="Italic">gopīs.</span>” Because this prayer was offered by Lord Brahmā, we follow him by reciting this prayer. That is the easiest way to satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The pure devotee never attempts to reach the Supreme Lord directly. The most important way to worship the Lord is to go through the disciplic succession of devotees. The prayers offered by Lord Śiva to the Supreme Personality of Godhead were thus repeated by the Pracetās, who were thus very successful in pleasing the Supreme Lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here the Supreme Personality of Godhead is described as <span class="Italic">purañjana.</span> According to Madhvācārya, the living entity is called <span class="Italic">purañjana</span> because he has become an inhabitant of this material world, and under the influence of the three modes of material nature, he is forced to live within it. The Supreme Personality of Godhead creates this material world (<span class="Italic">pura</span>), and He also enters within it. <span class="Italic">Aṇḍāntara-stha-paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham.</span> The Lord enters within the heart of the living entity and within the atom; therefore both the living entity and the Lord are called <span class="Italic">purañjana.</span> One <span class="Italic">purañjana,</span> the living entity, is subordinate to the supreme <span class="Italic">purañjana;</span> therefore the duty of the subordinate <span class="Italic">purañjana</span> is to satisfy the supreme <span class="Italic">purañjana.</span> That is devotional service. Lord Rudra, or Lord Śiva, is the original <span class="Italic">ācārya</span> of the Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">sampradāya</span> called the Rudra-sampradāya. <span class="Italic">Rudra-gītena</span> indicates that under the disciplic succession of Lord Rudra, the Pracetās achieved spiritual success.

            At the end of ten thousand years of severe austerities performed by the Pracetās, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to reward their austerities, appeared before them in His very pleasing form. This appealed to the Pracetās and satisfied the labor of their austerities.

            Performing ten thousand years of severe austerities does not seem a happy endeavor. Yet the devotees, the serious students of spiritual life, undergo such austerities to attain the favor of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. At that time, when the duration of life was very long, people could undergo severe austerities for thousands of years. It is said that Vālmīki, the author of <span class="Italic">Rāmāyaṇa,</span> underwent meditational austerities for sixty thousand years. The Supreme Personality of Godhead appreciated the austerities undergone by the Pracetās, and He finally appeared before them in a pleasing form. Thus they all became satisfied and forgot the austerities they underwent. In the material world, if one is successful after hard labor, he is very pleased. Similarly, the devotee forgets all his labors and austerities as soon as he contacts the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Although Dhruva Mahārāja was only a five-year-old boy, he underwent severe austerities by eating simply dry foliage, drinking only water and taking no food. In this way, after six months, he was able to see the Supreme Personality of Godhead face to face. When he saw the Lord, he forgot all his austerities and said, <span class="Italic">svāmin kṛtārtho’smi:</span> “My dear Lord, I am very pleased.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course, these austerities were performed in the Satya-yuga, Dvāpara-yuga and Tretā-yuga, but not in this age of Kali. In this Kali-yuga, one can attain the same results simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> Because the people of this age are fallen, the Lord is kind enough to give them the easiest method. Simply by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mantra,</span> one can attain the same results. However, as Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu points out, we are so unfortunate that we are not even attracted to chanting the <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span>—Hare Kṛṣṇa, Hare Kṛṣṇa, Kṛṣṇa Kṛṣṇa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rāma, Hare Rāma, Rāma Rāma, Hare Hare.

            The Lord is just like the effulgent sun. Consequently, whenever the Supreme Personality of Godhead is present, there cannot be darkness or ignorance. Actually this dark universe is illuminated by the sun, but the sun and moon simply reflect the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Lord. In <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.8) the Lord says, <span class="Italic">prabhāsmi śaśi-sūryayoḥ:</span> “I am the illuminating energy of both the sun and the moon.” The conclusion is that the origin of all life is the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is also confirmed in <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā:</span> <span class="Italic">yasya prabhā prabhavato jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi [Bs. </span>5.40]<span class="Italic">.</span> Being illuminated by the bodily effulgence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, everything is freed from all darkness.

            The Lord’s face was very beautiful, and His head was decorated with a shining helmet and golden ornaments. The helmet was dazzling and was very beautifully situated on His head. The Lord had eight arms, which each held a particular weapon. The Lord was surrounded by demigods, great sages and other associates. These were all engaged in His service. Garuḍa, the carrier of the Lord, glorified the Lord with Vedic hymns by flapping his wings. Garuḍa appeared to be an inhabitant of the planet known as Kinnaraloka.

            Generally the Viṣṇu form is manifested with four hands holding four objects (a conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower). However, here Lord Viṣṇu is described as possessing eight arms with eight kinds of weapons. According to Vīrarāghava Ācārya, the conchshell and lotus flower are also accepted as weapons. Since the Lord is the supreme controller, whatever is in His hand can be considered a weapon. Four hands hold four kinds of weapons, and the extra four hands hold an arrow, bow, trident and snake. Śrī Vīrarāghava Ācārya describes the eight weapons as <span class="Italic">śaṅkha, cakra, gadā, padma, śārṅga, śara,</span> etc.

          <p>
            A king is always accompanied by his ministers, secretaries and commanders, and Lord Viṣṇu is also accompanied by His followers—the demigods, great sages, saintly persons and so on. He is never alone. Consequently there is no question of the Lord’s being impersonal. He is always Himself, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and His associates are also persons. From the description given in this verse, Garuḍa appears to belong to the Kinnara planet. The inhabitants of the Kinnara planet have the same features as Garuḍa. Their bodily features are like those of a human being, but they have wings. The word <span class="Italic">gīta-kīrtiḥ</span> indicates that the inhabitants of Kinnaraloka are very expert in singing the glories of the Lord. In <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> it is said: <span class="Italic">jagad-aṇḍa-koṭi-koṭiṣv aśeṣa-vasudhādi-vibhūti-bhinnam.</span> In each and every universe there are different types of planets, and each planet has distinctive features. On the strength of this verse, we can understand that in Kinnaraloka the inhabitants can fly with their wings. There is also a planet, known as Siddhaloka, where the inhabitants can fly even without wings. Thus each and every planet has some distinctive facility. That is the beauty of the varied creation of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            Around the neck of the Personality of Godhead hung a flower garland that reached to His knees. His eight stout and elongated arms were decorated with that garland, which challenged the beauty of the goddess of fortune. With a merciful glance and a voice like thunder, the Lord addressed the sons of King Prācīnabarhiṣat, who were very much surrendered unto Him.

            The word <span class="Italic">ādyaḥ</span> in this verse is very significant. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is the origin even of Paramātmā and Brahman.

            Since the sons of King Prācīnabarhiṣat were all united in Kṛṣṇa consciousness, the Lord was very pleased with them. Each and every one of the sons of King Prācīnabarhiṣat was an individual soul, but they were united in offering transcendental service to the Lord. The unity of the individual souls attempting to satisfy the Supreme Lord or rendering service to the Lord is real unity. In the material world such unity is not possible. Even though people may officially unite, they all have different interests. In the United Nations, for instance, all the nations have their particular national ambitions, and consequently they cannot be united. Disunity between individual souls is so strong within this material world that even in a society of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, members sometimes appear disunited due to their having different opinions and leaning toward material things. Actually, in Kṛṣṇa consciousness there cannot be two opinions. There is only one goal: to serve Kṛṣṇa to one’s best ability. If there is some disagreement over service, such disagreement is to be taken as spiritual. Those who are actually engaged in the service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead cannot be disunited in any circumstance. This makes the Supreme Personality of Godhead very happy and willing to award all kinds of benediction to His devotees, as indicated in this verse. We can see that the Lord is immediately prepared to award all benedictions to the sons of King Prācīnabarhiṣat.

            One who offers prayers to the Lord to fulfill his different desires must know that the highest perfectional fulfillment of desire is to go back home, back to Godhead. In this verse it is indicated that those who remember the activities of the Pracetās, the sons of King Prācīnabarhiṣat, will be delivered and blessed. So what to speak of the sons of King Prācīnabarhiṣat, who are directly connected with the Supreme Personality of Godhead? This is the way of the <span class="Italic">paramparā</span> system. If we follow the <span class="Italic">ācāryas,</span> we attain the same benefit as our predecessors. If one follows the decisions of Arjuna, he should be considered to be directly hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. There is no difference between hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> directly from the Supreme Lord and following a personality like Arjuna, who formerly heard <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> directly from the Lord. Sometimes foolish people argue that since Kṛṣṇa is not present at the moment, one cannot take direct instructions from Him. Such foolish people do not know that there is no difference between directly hearing <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> and reading it, as long as one accepts <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> as it is, spoken by the Lord. However, if one wants to understand <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> by his imperfect interpretations, one cannot possibly understand the mysteries of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā,</span> even though one may be a great scholar according to mundane estimation.

            Since every living entity is part and parcel of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he has small independence. Sometimes unintelligent men ask why one is put into a miserable condition, even though everyone is under the control of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Because of his minute independence, the living entity can obey or disobey the orders of the Supreme Lord. If he obeys the Supreme Lord’s orders, he becomes happy. If he does not, he becomes unhappy. Therefore the living entity creates his own happiness or unhappiness. The Supreme Lord does not enforce these on anyone. The Supreme Lord praised the Pracetās because they all faithfully obeyed the orders of their father. The Lord therefore blessed the sons of King Prācīnabarhiṣat because they obeyed their father’s orders.

The great politician Cāṇakya said that if there is a good tree within a garden or forest, its flowers will fill the forest with their fragrance. Similarly, a good son within a family makes the whole family famous all over the world. Kṛṣṇa took birth in the family of the Yadus, and consequently the Yadu dynasty is famous all over the world.

            Whenever a great sage undergoes severe austerities for material power, the King of heaven, Indra, becomes very envious. All the demigods have responsible posts for the management of universal affairs and are very highly qualified with pious activities. Although they are ordinary living entities, they are able to attain responsible posts, like Lord Brahmā, Indra, Candra and Varuṇa. As is the nature of this material world, the King of heaven, Indra, is very anxious if a great sage undergoes severe austerities. The whole material world is filled with such envy that everyone becomes afraid of his neighbors. Every businessman is afraid of his associates because this material world is the field of activities for all kinds of envious people who have come here to compete with the opulence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus Indra was very much afraid of the severe austerities performed by the great sage Kaṇḍu, and he sent Pramlocā to break his vows and austerities. A similar incident took place in the case of Viśvāmitra. From other incidents in the <span class="Italic">śāstras,</span> it appears that Indra has always been envious. When King Pṛthu was celebrating various sacrifices, outdoing Indra, Indra became very envious, and he disturbed King Pṛthu’s sacrifice. This has already been discussed in previous chapters. King Indra became successful in breaking the vow of the great sage Kaṇḍu, who became attracted by the beauty of the heavenly society girl Pramlocā and begot a female child. This child is described herein as lotus-eyed and very beautiful. Being thus successful in her mission, Pramlocā returned to the heavenly planets, leaving the newborn child to the care of the trees. Fortunately, the trees accepted the child and agreed to raise her.

            According to Vedic principles, a woman cannot have many husbands, although a husband can have many wives. In special instances, however, it is found that a woman has more than one husband. Draupadī, for instance, was married to all of the five Pāṇḍava brothers. Similarly, the Supreme Personality of Godhead ordered all the sons of Prācīnabarhiṣat to marry the one girl born of the great sage Kaṇḍu and Pramlocā. In special cases, a girl is allowed to marry more than one man, provided she is able to treat her husbands equally. This is not possible for an ordinary woman. Only one who is especially qualified can be allowed to marry more than one husband. In this age of Kali, to find such an equipoised woman is very difficult. Thus according to scripture, <span class="Italic">kalau pañca vivarjayet.</span> In this age a woman is forbidden to marry her husband’s brother. This system is still practiced in some of the hilly tracts of India. The Lord says: <span class="Italic">apṛthag-dharma-śīleyaṁ bhūyāt patny arpitāśayā.</span> With the blessings of the Lord, all things are possible. The Lord especially blessed the girl to surrender equally to all brothers. <span class="Italic">Apṛthag-dharma,</span> meaning “occupational duty without difference of purpose,” is taught in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā.</span> <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> is divided into three primary divisions—<span class="Italic">karma-yoga, jñāna-yoga</span> and <span class="Italic">bhakti-yoga.</span> The word <span class="Italic">yoga</span> means “acting on behalf of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.” As confirmed by <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (3.9):

            The duration of life prescribed for the Pracetās by the Supreme Personality of Godhead is calculated by the time measurements of higher planetary systems. Our six earth months are said to equal twelve hours in the higher planetary systems. Thirty days equal one month, and twelve months equal one year. In this way, for one million years according to the calculations of the higher planetary system the Pracetās were allowed to enjoy all kinds of material facilities. Although this life-span was so long, the Pracetās were given full bodily strength by the grace of the Lord. In the material world, if one wants to live for many years, he must endure the difficulties of old age, invalidity and many other miserable conditions. The Pracetās, however, were given full bodily strength to enjoy material facilities. This special facility was given to the Pracetās so that they could continue rendering full devotional service.

            Thereafter you will develop unadulterated devotional service unto Me and be freed from all material contamination. At that time, being completely unattached to material enjoyment in the so-called heavenly planets as well as in hellish planets, you will return home, back to Godhead.

            By the grace of the Lord, the Pracetās were given special facilities. Although they could live millions of years to enjoy material facilities, they still would not be deviated from the transcendental loving service of the Lord. Being thus fully engaged, the Pracetās would be completely freed from all material attachment. Material attachment is very strong. During one lifetime, a materialist engages in acquiring land, money, friends, society, friendship, love and so on. He also wants to enjoy the heavenly planets after the annihilation of the body. If one is engaged in devotional service, however, he becomes unattached to all kinds of material enjoyment and suffering. In the material world, those who are elevated to the higher planetary systems are supposed to enjoy all material facilities, whereas those degraded to lower planetary systems are supposed to live in a hellish condition. A devotee, however, is transcendental to both heavenly and hellish conditions. According to <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (14.26), a devotee’s position is described in this way:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">māṁ ca yo ’vyabhicāreṇa<br>bhakti-yogena sevate<br>sa guṇān samatītyaitān<br>brahma-bhūyāya kalpate</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “One who engages in full devotional service, who does not fall down in any circumstance, at once transcends the modes of material nature and thus comes to the level of Brahman.”
          </p>
          <p>
            A devotee is always situated on the Brahman platform. He has nothing to do with material happiness or distress. When one is strongly fixed in devotional service and free from all material attachment, uncontaminated by the material modes of nature, he becomes fit to return home, back to Godhead. Although by special blessing the Pracetās would enjoy material facilities for millions of years, they would not be attached to them. Thus at the end of their material enjoyment they would be promoted to the spiritual world and return to Godhead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word <span class="Italic">pakva-guṇāśayāḥ</span> has special significance, for it means that by devotional service one is able to give up the influence of the three modes of material nature. As long as one is influenced by the modes of material nature, he cannot return to Godhead. It is clearly explained that all planets in the material world—beginning from Brahmaloka down to the hellish planets—are unfit places for a devotee. <span class="Italic">padaṁ padaṁ yad vipadāṁ na teṣām.</span> A place where there is danger at every step is certainly not a comfortable place. The Lord therefore says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (8.16):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">ābrahma-bhuvanāl lokāḥ<br>punar āvartino ’rjuna<br>mām upetya tu kaunteya<br>punar janma na vidyate</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “From the highest planet in the material world down to the lowest, all are places of misery wherein repeated birth and death take place. But one who attains to My abode, O son of Kuntī, never takes birth again.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus there is no profit, even if one is promoted to the highest planet in the material universe, Brahmaloka. However, if one is somehow or other promoted to the abode of the Lord, he never returns to the material world.

            Those who are engaged in auspicious activities in devotional service certainly understand that the ultimate enjoyer or beneficiary of all activities is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Thus when one acts, he offers the results to the Supreme Personality of Godhead and passes life always engaged in the topics of the Lord. Even though such a person may be participating in family life, he is not affected by the results of his actions.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_19_purport">
          <p>
            Generally a person living in a family becomes overly attached to fruitive activity. In other words, he tries to enjoy the results of his activities. A devotee, however, knows that Kṛṣṇa is the supreme enjoyer and the supreme proprietor (<span class="Italic">bhoktāraṁ yajña-tapasāṁ sarva-loka-maheśvaram [Bg. </span>5.29]). Consequently, the devotee does not consider himself the proprietor of any occupation. The devotee always thinks of the Supreme Personality of Godhead as the proprietor; therefore the results of his business are offered to the Supreme Lord. One who thus lives in the material world with his family and children never becomes affected by the contaminations of the material world. This is confirmed in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (3.9):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">yajñārthāt karmaṇo ’nyatra<br>loko ’yaṁ karma-bandhanaḥ<br>tad-arthaṁ karma kaunteya<br>mukta-saṅgaḥ samācara</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            One who tries to enjoy the results of his activities becomes bound by the results. One who offers the results or profits to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, does not become entangled in the results. This is the secret of success. Generally people take <span class="Italic">sannyāsa</span> to become free from the reactions of fruitive activity. One who does not receive the results of his actions but offers them instead to the Supreme Personality of Godhead certainly remains in a liberated condition. In <span class="Italic">Bhakti-rasāmṛta-sindhu,</span> Śrī Rūpa Gosvāmī confirms this:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">īhā yasya harer dāsye<br>karmaṇā manasā girā<br>nikhilāsv apy avasthāsu<br>jīvan-muktaḥ sa ucyate</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            If one engages himself in the service of the Lord through his life, wealth, words, intelligence and everything he possesses, he will always be liberated in any condition. Such a person is called a <span class="Italic">jīvan-mukta,</span> one who is liberated during this lifetime. Devoid of Kṛṣṇa consciousness, those who engage in material activities simply become more entangled in material bondage. They have to suffer and enjoy the actions and reactions of all activity. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is therefore the greatest boon to humanity because it keeps one always engaged in Kṛṣṇa’s service. The devotees think of Kṛṣṇa, act for Kṛṣṇa, eat for Kṛṣṇa, sleep for Kṛṣṇa and work for Kṛṣṇa. Thus everything is engaged in the service of Kṛṣṇa. A total life in Kṛṣṇa consciousness saves one from material contamination. As stated by Bhaktisiddhānta Sarasvatī Gosvāmī Mahārāja:
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">kṛṣṇa-bhajane yāhā haya anukūla<br>viṣaya baliyā tyāge tāhā haya bhūla</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            If one is so expert that he can engage everything or dovetail everything in the service of the Lord, to give up the material world would be a great blunder. One should learn how to dovetail everything in the service of the Lord, for everything is connected to Kṛṣṇa. That is the real purpose of life and secret of success. As reiterated later in the Third Chapter of <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (3.19):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">tasmād asaktaḥ satataṁ<br>kāryaṁ karma samācara<br>asakto hy ācaran karma<br>param āpnoti pūruṣaḥ</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “Therefore, without being attached to the fruits of activities, one should act as a matter of duty; for by working without attachment, one attains the Supreme.”
          </p>
          <p>
            The Third Chapter of <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> specifically considers material activities for the purpose of sense gratification and material activities for the purpose of satisfying the Supreme Lord. The conclusion is that these are not one and the same. Material activities for sense gratification are the cause of material bondage, whereas the very same activities for the satisfaction of Kṛṣṇa are the cause of liberation. How the same activity can be the cause of bondage and liberation can be explained as follows. One may get indigestion due to eating too many milk preparations—condensed milk, sweet rice, and so on. But even though there is indigestion or diarrhea, another milk preparation—yogurt mixed with black pepper and salt—will immediately cure these maladies. In other words, one milk preparation can cause indigestion and diarrhea, and another milk preparation can cure them.
          </p>
          <p>
            If one is placed in material opulence due to the special mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he should not consider that opulence a cause for bondage. When a mature devotee is blessed with material opulence, he does not become affected adversely, for he knows how to employ material opulence in the service of the Lord. There are many such examples in the history of the world. There were kings like Pṛthu Mahārāja, Prahlāda Mahārāja, Janaka, Dhruva, Vaivasvata Manu and Mahārāja Ikṣvāku. All of these were great kings and were especially favored by the Supreme Personality of Godhead. If a devotee is not mature, the Supreme Lord will take away all his opulence. This principle is stated by the Supreme Personality of Godhead—<span class="Italic">yasyāham anugṛhṇāmi hariṣye tad-dhanaṁ śanaiḥ:</span> “My first mercy shown to My devotee is to take away all his material opulence.” Material opulence detrimental to devotional service is taken away by the Supreme Lord, whereas a person who is mature in devotional service is given all material facilities.

            Always engaging in the activities of devotional service, devotees feel ever-increasingly fresh and new in all their activities. The all-knower, the Supersoul within the heart of the devotee, makes everything increasingly fresh. This is known as the Brahman position by the advocates of the Absolute Truth. In such a liberated stage [brahma-bhūta], one is never bewildered. Nor does one lament or become unnecessarily jubilant. This is due to the brahma-bhūta situation.

            A devotee is inspired by the Supersoul within the heart to advance in devotional service in a variety of ways. The devotee does not feel hackneyed or stereotyped, nor does he feel that he is in a stagnant position. In the material world, if one engages in chanting a material name, he will feel tired after chanting a few times. However, one can chant the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra</span> all day and night and never feel tired. As chanting is increased, it will come out new and fresh. Śrīla Rūpa Gosvāmī said that if he could somehow get millions of ears and tongues, then he could relish spiritual bliss by chanting the Hare Kṛṣṇa <span class="Italic">mahā-mantra.</span> There is really nothing uninspiring for a highly advanced devotee. In <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> the Lord says that He is situated in everyone’s heart and that He helps the living entity forget and remember.

Being inspired by Him, the devotee experiences increased transcendental bliss in the execution of his devotional service.

The Lord is the bestower of all success in life and is the supreme benefactor. He is also the supreme friend who takes away all miserable conditions experienced by a devotee. In a faltering voice, due to ecstasy, the Pracetās began to offer prayers. They were purified by the presence of the Lord, who was before them face to face.

Whatever success we want in life can be attained by the mercy of the Lord. Since the Pracetās had already attained the Lord’s mercy, they were no longer subject to the contamination of the material modes. The material modes dissipated from them just as the darkness of night immediately dissipates when the sun rises. Because the Lord appeared before them, naturally all the contaminations of the material qualities of <span class="Italic">rajas</span> and <span class="Italic">tamas</span> completely disappeared.

          </p>
          <p>
            The holy name of the Lord is the Lord Himself. If one chants and hears, he becomes purified. Gradually all material contamination disappears. The Pracetās were already purified due to the Lord’s presence before them, and they could therefore offer the proper prayers with folded hands. In other words, as soon as devotees are engaged in devotional service, they become transcendental to all material contamination immediately, as confirmed in <span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (<span class="Italic">sa guṇān samatītyaitān brahma-bhūyāya kalpate [Bg. </span>14.26]). Sometimes the devotees are dissatisfied due to their not seeing the Supreme Personality of Godhead personally. When the Pracetās saw the Supreme Lord personally present, their unhappiness vanished.

Lord Viṣṇu is therefore known as <span class="Italic">viśuddha-sattva.</span> His existence is completely free from the contamination of the material modes of nature. One should therefore not think that Lord Viṣṇu is in the same category with Lord Brahmā and Śiva. The <span class="Italic">śāstras</span> forbid us to think in this way.

            One who considers Lord Viṣṇu to be in the same category with <span class="Italic">devas</span> like Lord Brahmā or Lord Śiva or who thinks Lord Brahmā and Śiva to be equal to Lord Viṣṇu is to be considered as <span class="Italic">pāṣaṇḍī</span> (a faithless nonbeliever). Therefore in this verse Lord Viṣṇu is distinguished in the words <span class="Italic">namo viśuddha-sattvāya.</span> Although a living entity like us, Lord Brahmā is exalted due to his pious activities; therefore he is given the high post of Brahmā. Lord Śiva is not actually like a living entity, but he is not the Supreme Personality of Godhead. His position is somewhere between Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and Brahmā, the living entity. Lord Śiva is therefore explained in <span class="Ref_Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā</span> (5.45) in this way:

            Lord Śiva is considered to be like yogurt (<span class="Italic">dadhi</span>). Yogurt is nothing but transformed milk; nonetheless, yogurt cannot be accepted as milk. Similarly, Lord Śiva holds almost all the powers of Lord Viṣṇu, and he is also above the qualities of the living entity, but he is not exactly like Viṣṇu, just as yogurt, although transformed milk, is not exactly like milk.

            The Supreme Personality of Godhead is also described herein as <span class="Italic">vāsudevāya kṛṣṇāya.</span> Kṛṣṇa is the original Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all Viṣṇu expansions are His plenary portions or portions of His plenary portions (known as <span class="Italic">svāṁśa</span> and <span class="Italic">kalā</span>).

Kṛṣṇa is known as Vāsudeva because He appeared in this material world as the son of Vasudeva. Similarly, He is known as Devakī-nandana, Yaśodā-nandana, Nanda-nandana and so on.

            Again and again the Lord is very much interested in increasing the influence of His devotees. Therefore He is described herein as <span class="Italic">prabhave sarva-sātvatām.</span> The <span class="Italic">sātvata</span> community is a community of Vaiṣṇavas, pure devotees of the Lord. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has unlimited powers, and He wants to see that His devotees are also entrusted with unlimited powers. A devotee of the Lord is always, therefore, distinguished from all other living entities.

            “I am seated in everyone’s heart, and from Me come remembrance, knowledge and forgetfulness.” The Lord is present in everyone’s heart, and He gives the living entity intelligence. According to the desires of the living entity, the Lord makes him remember or forget. If the living entity is demoniac and wants to forget the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the Lord gives him the intelligence to be able to forget the Supreme Lord forever. Similarly, when a devotee wants to serve the Supreme Lord, the Lord, as Paramātmā, gives the devotee the intelligence to make progress in devotional service. The Lord directly witnesses our activities and experiences our desires. The Supreme Lord gives us the facilities to act in the way we wish.

            When the Lord appears in His original form, He acts to deliver the pious and annihilate the miscreants (Bg. 4.8). Although He annihilates the demons, He nonetheless benefits them. It is said that all the living entities who died on the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra attained their original constitutional position (<span class="Italic">svarūpa</span>) because they had the chance to see Kṛṣṇa face to face riding in the chariot of Arjuna. On the Battlefield of Kurukṣetra, superficially two things were going on—the demons were being killed, and the devotee, Arjuna, was being protected. However, the results were the same for everyone. Thus it is said that the appearance of the Lord diminishes all kinds of miserable conditions caused by material existence.

            It is clearly stated in this verse that this form (<span class="Italic">aśeṣa-kleśa-saṅkṣayam</span>) is meant to diminish all the miserable conditions experienced in life not only by the devotees but by all others. <span class="Italic">Āviṣkṛtaṁ naḥ kliṣṭānām.</span> The Pracetās identified themselves as common men. <span class="Italic">Kim anyad anukampitam.</span> The devotees are always favorably accepted by the Lord.

Deity worship in the form of temple worship is the most valuable benediction given by the Lord to beginners.

Atheists may think that the devotees are engaged in idol worship, but the fact is different. Janārdana, the Supreme Lord, accepts <span class="Italic">bhāva,</span> the attitude of service. The neophyte devotee engaged in the worship of the Lord may not understand the value of such worship, but the Supreme Lord, being <span class="Italic">bhakta-vatsala,</span> accepts His devotee and in due course of time takes him home.

            In this connection there is a story about a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> who was offering sweet rice to the Lord within his mind. The <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> had no money nor any means of worshiping the Deity, but within his mind he arranged everything nicely. He had gold pots to bring water from the sacred rivers to wash the Deity, and he offered the Deity very sumptuous food, including sweet rice. Once, before he offered the sweet rice, he thought that it was too hot, and he thought, “Oh, let me test it. My, it is very hot.” When he put his finger in the sweet rice to test it, his finger was burned and his meditation broken. Although he was offering food to the Lord within his mind, the Lord accepted it nonetheless. Consequently, the Lord in Vaikuṇṭha immediately sent a chariot to bring the <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> back home, back to Godhead. Thus it is the duty of every sincere devotee to accept the <span class="Italic">arcā-vigraha</span> at home or in the temple and worship the form of the Lord as advised in authorized scriptures and directed by the spiritual master.

A pure devotee simply wants to engage in the service of the Lord without material desire, and if he wants this within the core of his heart, where the Lord is situated, and if he is without ulterior motive, why should the Lord not understand? If a sincere devotee renders service to the Lord or to the <span class="Italic">arcā-vigraha,</span> the form of the Lord, all his activities prove successful because the Lord is present within his heart and understands his sincerity.

            In this verse the words <span class="Italic">apavarga-gurur gatiḥ</span> are very significant. According to <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (1.2.11), the Supreme Lord is the ultimate fact of the Absolute Truth. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate.</span> The Absolute Truth is realized in three features—impersonal Brahman, localized Paramātmā and ultimately the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān. The word <span class="Italic">apavarga</span> means “liberation.” <span class="Italic">pavarga</span> means “material existence.” In material existence, one always works very hard but is ultimately baffled. One then dies and has to accept another body to work very hard again. This is the cycle of material existence. <span class="Italic">Apavarga</span> means just the opposite. Instead of working hard like cats and dogs, one returns home, back to Godhead. Liberation begins with merging into the Brahman effulgence of the Supreme Lord. This conception is held by the <span class="Italic">jñānī-sampradāya,</span> philosophical speculators, but realization of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is higher. When a devotee understands that the Lord is satisfied, liberation, or merging into the effulgence of the Lord, is not very difficult. One has to approach the Supreme Personality of Godhead through the impersonal Brahman effulgence just as one has to approach the sun through the sunshine. It is not very difficult to merge into the impersonal effulgence of the Lord, Brahman, if one has satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

            There was no need for the Pracetās to ask any benediction from the Supreme Lord because the devotees are simply satisfied by the presence of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Dhruva Mahārāja practiced severe austerities and penances to see the Supreme Lord, and his intention was to receive benediction from the Lord. He wanted to acquire the throne of his father—or attain an even better position—but when he was actually in the presence of the Supreme Lord, he forgot everything. He said, “My dear Lord, I do not wish to ask any benediction.” This is the actual position of the devotee. The devotee simply wants to be in the presence of the Supreme Lord—either in this world or in the next—and engage in His service. That is the ultimate goal and benediction for the devotees.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Lord asked the Pracetās to pray for some benediction, and they said, “What kind of benediction should we pray for? The Lord is unlimited, and there are unlimited benedictions.” The purport is that if one must ask for benediction, he must ask for unlimited benediction. The words <span class="Italic">tvat parataḥ</span> are very significant in this verse. The Supreme Personality of Godhead is <span class="Italic">parataḥ parāt.</span> The word <span class="Italic">para</span> means “transcendental, beyond this material world.” The impersonal Brahman effulgence is beyond this material world, and this is called <span class="Italic">paraṁ padam.</span> <span class="Italic">Āruhya kṛcchreṇa paraṁ padam</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 10.2.32). Merging into the impersonal effulgence of the Lord is called <span class="Italic">paraṁ padam,</span> but there is a higher transcendental position, which is the association of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Brahmeti paramātmeti bhagavān iti śabdyate</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 1.2.11). The Absolute Truth is realized first as impersonal Brahman, then as Paramātmā, and finally as Bhagavān. Thus the Personality of Godhead, Bhagavān, is <span class="Italic">parataḥ parāt,</span> beyond Brahman and Paramātmā realization. In this connection, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī points out that <span class="Italic">parataḥ parāt</span> means “better than the best.” The best is the spiritual world, and it is known as Brahman. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, however, is known as Parabrahman. Therefore <span class="Italic">parataḥ parāt</span> means “better than Brahman realization.”
          </p>
          <p>
            As will be explained in the next verses, the Pracetās planned to ask the Lord for something that has no limit. The Lord’s pastimes, qualities, forms and names are all unlimited. There is no limit to His name, forms, pastimes, creation and paraphernalia. The living entity cannot conceive of the unlimitedness of the unlimited. However, if living entities are engaged in hearing about the unlimited potencies of the Supreme Lord, they are factually connected directly to the unlimited. Such understanding of the unlimited becomes unlimited by hearing and chanting.

            Dear Lord, when the bee approaches the celestial tree called the pārijāta, it certainly does not leave the tree, because there is no need for such action. Similarly, when we have approached Your lotus feet and taken shelter of them, what further benediction may we ask of You?

            When a devotee is actually engaged in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, his engagement in itself is so perfect that there is no need to ask for further benediction. When a bee approaches the <span class="Italic">pārijāta</span> tree, it gets unlimited supplies of honey. There is no need to go to another tree. If one is fixed in the service of the lotus feet of the Lord, there is unlimited transcendental bliss, and as such there is no need to ask for further benediction. The <span class="Italic">pārijāta</span> tree is not commonly found within this material world. The <span class="Italic">pārijāta</span> tree is also known as <span class="Italic">kalpa-vṛkṣa,</span> or the wish-fulfilling tree. One can get anything he desires from such a tree. In the material world, one can get oranges from an orange tree or mangoes from a mango tree, but there is no possibility of getting oranges from a mango tree or vice versa. However, one can get whatever he wants from the <span class="Italic">pārijāta</span> tree—oranges, mangoes, bananas and so on. This tree is found in the spiritual world. <span class="Italic">Cintāmaṇi-prakara-sadmasu kalpa-vṛkṣa-lakṣāvṛteṣu [Bs. </span>5.29]<span class="Italic">.</span> The spiritual world, <span class="Italic">cintāmaṇi-dhāma,</span> is surrounded by these <span class="Italic">kalpa-vṛkṣa</span> trees, but the <span class="Italic">pārijāta</span> tree is also found in the kingdom of Indra, that is, on Indra’s heavenly planet. This <span class="Italic">pārijāta</span> tree was brought by Kṛṣṇa to please Satyabhāmā, one of His queens, and this tree was implanted in the Dvārakā mansions constructed for the queens. The lotus feet of the Lord are exactly like the <span class="Italic">pārijāta</span> trees, or wish-fulfilling trees, and the devotees are like bumblebees. They are always attracted by the lotus feet of the Lord.

            This is the best benediction that a devotee can ask of the Supreme Lord. This is also confirmed by Śrī Caitanya Mahāprabhu: <span class="Italic">sthāne sthitāḥ śruti-gatāṁ tanu-vāṅ-manobhiḥ</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 10.14.3). One may be in one position or another according to destiny, but in any case one must continue to hear about the activities and pastimes of the Supreme Lord, regardless of circumstances. A pure devotee does not pray for liberation or for cessation of the cycle of birth and death because he does not consider that important. The most important thing for a devotee is getting a chance to hear about the pastimes and glories of the Lord. The devotees who engage in the service of the Lord in this world will have the same opportunity in the spiritual world also. Thus for a devotee, everything is in the spiritual world, for as long as he can hear about the pastimes of the Lord, or wherever he can chant, the Lord is personally present. <span class="Italic">Tatra tiṣṭhāmi nārada yatra gāyanti mad-bhaktāḥ.</span> When the pure devotees assemble to chant, hear and talk about the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the place where they assemble becomes Vaikuṇṭha. For the devotee there is no need to pray to the Lord for transferal to the Vaikuṇṭha world. A pure devotee can create Vaikuṇṭha or Vṛndāvana anywhere simply by chanting the glories of the Lord without offense.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Pracetās pray for an opportunity to hear of the glories of the Lord in every form of life (<span class="Italic">bhave bhave</span>). A living entity transmigrates from one body to another. The devotee is not particularly eager to stop this process. Caitanya Mahāprabhu prays, <span class="Italic">mama janmani janmanīśvare bhavatād bhaktir ahaitukī tvayi:</span> “My dear Lord, life after life may I be fixed in Your pure devotional service.” Out of humility, a devotee considers himself unfit to be transferred to the spiritual world. He always thinks himself contaminated by the modes of material nature. Nor is there any need for a devotee to ask to be freed from the modes of material nature. Devotional service itself is in the transcendental position; therefore there is no question of asking for this special facility. The conclusion is that a pure devotee is not anxious to stop the repetition of birth and death, but is always eager to associate with other devotees who are engaged in chanting and hearing about the glories of the Lord.

            Even a moment’s association with a pure devotee cannot be compared to being transferred to heavenly planets or even merging into the Brahman effulgence in complete liberation. For living entities who are destined to give up the body and die, association with pure devotees is the highest benediction.

            The great saint Prabodhānanda Sarasvatī, a devotee of Lord Caitanya, has stated: <span class="Italic">kaivalyaṁ narakāyate tridaśa-pūr ākāśa-puṣpāyate.</span> For a pure devotee, <span class="Italic">kaivalya,</span> merging into the existence of Brahman, the Brahman effulgence, is no better than living in hell. Similarly, he considers promotion to heavenly planets (<span class="Italic">tridaśa-pūr</span>) just another kind of phantasmagoria. In other words, a pure devotee does not place much value in the destination of the <span class="Italic">karmīs</span> (the heavenly planets) or in the destination of the <span class="Italic">jñānīs</span> (merging into the Brahman effulgence). A pure devotee considers a moment’s association with another pure devotee to be far superior to residing in a heavenly planet or merging in the Brahman effulgence. The topmost benediction for those who are living in this material world and are subjected to the repetition of birth and death (transmigration) is association with pure devotees. One should search out such pure devotees and remain with them. That will make one completely happy, even though living within the material world. This Kṛṣṇa consciousness movement is started for that purpose. A person who is overly affected materially may take advantage of this movement and become intimately associated with it. In this way the confused and frustrated inhabitants of this material world may find the highest happiness in association with devotees.

This atmosphere is without fear and anxiety. One living entity does not fear another. By hearing the holy names and glories of the Lord, a person executes pious activities. <span class="Italic">Śṛṇvatāṁ sva-kathāḥ kṛṣṇaḥ puṇya-śravaṇa-kīrtanaḥ</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 1.2.17).

The Pracetās therefore decided to remain always in the society of devotees, and they considered that to be the highest benediction possible in human life.

            The Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs</span> are missing the real presence of Nārāyaṇa. This is because they falsely claim to be Nārāyaṇa Himself. According to the customary etiquette of Māyāvādī <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs,</span> they address one another as Nārāyaṇa. To say that everyone is a temple of Nārāyaṇa is correct, but to accept another human being as Nārāyaṇa is a great offense. The conception of <span class="Italic">daridra-nārāyaṇa</span> (poor Nārāyaṇa), an attempt to identify the poor with Nārāyaṇa, is also a great offense. Even to identify Nārāyaṇa with demigods like Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva is an offense.

Then Nārāyaṇa Himself descends and immediately is present. In this age of Kali, Nārāyaṇa is immediately present in the form of Lord Caitanya. Concerning Lord Caitanya, <span class="Ref_Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam</span> (11.5.32) states:

Although His complexion is not blackish, He is Kṛṣṇa Himself. He is accompanied by His associates, servants, weapons and confidential companions.” After all, human life is meant for pleasing Nārāyaṇa, and this can easily be done by performing <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña.</span> Whenever there is congregational chanting of the holy names of the Lord, Gaura Nārāyaṇa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead in His incarnation as Lord Caitanya, immediately appears and is worshiped by <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña.</span>

            In this verse it is said that Nārāyaṇa is <span class="Italic">nyāsināṁ gatiḥ,</span> the ultimate goal of the <span class="Italic">sannyāsīs.</span> The goal of those who have renounced the material world is the attainment of Nārāyaṇa. A Vaiṣṇava <span class="Italic">sannyāsī</span> therefore dedicates his life to serving Nārāyaṇa; he does not falsely claim to be Nārāyaṇa. Instead of becoming <span class="Italic">nirvaira</span> (nonenvious of other living entities), one who tries to become Nārāyaṇa becomes envious of the Supreme Lord. Therefore the attempt to become Nārāyaṇa constitutes the greatest offense. Actually, when one chants or discusses the transcendental activities of the Lord, he immediately becomes nonenvious. In this material world everyone is envious of everyone else, but by vibrating or discussing the holy name of the Lord, one becomes nonenvious and devoid of material hankering. Because of our envy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, we have become envious of all other living entities. When we are no longer envious of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, there will be real peace, unity and fraternity in human society. Without Nārāyaṇa or <span class="Italic">saṅkīrtana-yajña</span> there cannot be peace in this material world.

The <span class="Italic">goṣṭhānandī</span> is one who desires to increase the number of devotees all over the world.

            Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu wanted His followers to move all over the world to preach in every town and village. In the Caitanya-sampradāya those who strictly follow the principles of Lord Caitanya must travel all over the world to preach the message of Lord Caitanya, which is the same as preaching the words of Kṛṣṇa—<span class="Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span>—and <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam.</span> The more the devotees preach the principles of <span class="Italic">kṛṣṇa-kathā,</span> the more people throughout the world will benefit.

            Devotees like the great sage Nārada, who travel all over to preach, are called <span class="Italic">goṣṭhānandī.</span> Nārada Muni is always wandering throughout the universe just to create different types of devotees. Nārada even made a hunter a devotee. He also made Dhruva Mahārāja and Prahlāda devotees. Actually, all devotees are indebted to the great sage Nārada, for he has wandered both in heaven and in hell. A devotee of the Lord is not even afraid of hell. He goes to preach the glories of the Lord everywhere—even in hell—because there is no distinction between heaven and hell for a devotee.

            “A pure devotee of Nārāyaṇa is never afraid of going anywhere and everywhere. For him heaven and hell are one and the same.” (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 6.17.28) Such devotees, wandering all over the world, deliver those who are actually afraid of this material existence. Some people are already disgusted with material existence, being confused and frustrated by material enjoyment, and some people, who are intelligent, are interested in understanding the Supreme Lord. Both may take advantage of the pure devotee who wanders throughout the world.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a pure devotee goes to a place of pilgrimage, he desires to purify that holy place of pilgrimage. Many sinful men bathe in the holy waters of the places of pilgrimage. They take their baths in the waters of the Ganges and Yamunā at places such as Prayāga, Vṛndāvana and Mathurā. In this way the sinful men are purified, but their sinful actions and reactions remain at the holy places of pilgrimage. When a devotee comes to take his bath at those places of pilgrimage, the sinful reactions left by the sinful men are neutralized by the devotee. <span class="Italic">Tīrthī-kurvanti tīrthāni svāntaḥ-sthena gadā-bhṛtā</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 1.13.10). Because the devotee always carries the Supreme Personality of Godhead within his heart, wherever he goes becomes a place of pilgrimage, a holy place for understanding the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is therefore the duty of everyone to associate with a pure devotee and thus attain freedom from material contamination. Everyone should take advantage of the wandering devotees, whose only business is to deliver conditioned souls from the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā.</span>

            Dear Lord, by virtue of a moment’s association with Lord Śiva, who is very dear to You and who is Your most intimate friend, we were fortunate to attain You. You are the most expert physician, capable of treating the incurable disease of material existence. On account of our great fortune, we have been able to take shelter at Your lotus feet.

            It has been said: <span class="Italic">hariṁ vinā na sṛtiṁ taranti.</span> Without taking shelter of the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, one cannot attain relief from the clutches of <span class="Italic">māyā,</span> the repetition of birth, old age, disease and death. The Pracetās received the shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead by the grace of Lord Śiva. Lord Śiva is the supreme devotee of Lord Viṣṇu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇavānāṁ yathā śambhuḥ:</span> the most exalted Vaiṣṇava is Lord Śiva, and those who are actually devotees of Lord Śiva follow Lord Śiva’s advice and take shelter at the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu. The so-called devotees of Lord Śiva, who are simply after material prosperity, are in a way deceived by Lord Śiva. He does not actually deceive them, because Lord Śiva has no business deceiving people, but because the so-called devotees of Lord Śiva want to be deceived, Lord Śiva, who is very easily pleased, allows them all kinds of material benedictions. These benedictions might ironically result in the destruction of the so-called devotees. For instance, Rāvaṇa took all material benediction from Lord Śiva, but the result was that he was ultimately destroyed with his family, kingdom and everything else because he misused Lord Śiva’s benediction. Because of his material power, he became very proud and puffed up so that he dared kidnap the wife of Lord Rāmacandra. In this way he was ruined. To get material benedictions from Lord Śiva is not difficult, but actually these are not benedictions. The Pracetās received benediction from Lord Śiva, and as a result they attained the shelter of the lotus feet of Lord Viṣṇu. This is real benediction. The <span class="Italic">gopīs</span> also worshiped Lord Śiva in Vṛndāvana, and the lord is still staying there as Gopīśvara. The <span class="Italic">gopīs,</span> however, prayed that Lord Śiva bless them by giving them Lord Kṛṣṇa as their husband. There is no harm in worshiping the demigods, provided that one’s aim is to return home, back to Godhead. Generally people go to the demigods for material benefit, as indicated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (7.20):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">kāmais tais tair hṛta-jñānāḥ<br>prapadyante ’nya-devatāḥ<br>taṁ taṁ niyamam āsthāya<br>prakṛtyā niyatāḥ svayā</div>
            </div>

          </p>
          <p>
            “Those whose minds are distorted by material desires surrender unto demigods and follow the particular rules and regulations of worship according to their own natures.” One enamored by material benefits is called <span class="Italic">hṛta jñāna</span> (“one who has lost his intelligence”). In this connection it is to be noted that sometimes in revealed scriptures Lord Śiva is described as being nondifferent from the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The point is that Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu are so intimately connected that there is no difference in opinion. The actual fact is, <span class="Italic">ekale īśvara kṛṣṇa, āra saba bhṛtya:</span> “The only supreme master is Kṛṣṇa, and all others are His devotees or servants.” (Cc. <span class="Ref_Italic">Ādi</span> 5.142) This is the real fact, and there is no difference of opinion between Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu in this connection. Nowhere in revealed scripture does Lord Śiva claim to be equal to Lord Viṣṇu. This is simply the creation of the so-called devotees of Lord Śiva, who claim that Lord Śiva and Lord Viṣṇu are one. This is strictly forbidden in the <span class="Italic">Vaiṣṇava-tantra:</span> <span class="Italic">yas tu nārāyaṇaṁ devam.</span> Lord Viṣṇu, Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā are intimately connected as master and servants. <span class="Italic">Śiva-viriñci-nutam.</span> Viṣṇu is honored and offered obeisances by Lord Śiva and Lord Brahmā. To consider that they are all equal is a great offense. They are all equal in the sense that Lord Viṣṇu is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and all others are His eternal servants.

            Dear Lord, we have studied the Vedas, accepted a spiritual master and offered respect to brāhmaṇas, advanced devotees and aged personalities who are spiritually very advanced. We have offered our respects to them, and we have not been envious of any brother, friends or anyone else. We have also undergone severe austerities within the water and have not taken food for a long time. All these spiritual assets of ours are simply offered for Your satisfaction.

            As stated in <span class="Italic">Śrīmad-Bhāgavatam, saṁsiddhir hari-toṣaṇam: [SB 1.2.13]</span> the real perfection of life is pleasing the Supreme Personality of Godhead. <span class="Italic">Vedaiś ca sarvair aham eva vedyaḥ: [Bg. </span>15.15] in understanding the <span class="Italic">Vedas,</span> one has to understand the Supreme Personality of Godhead. One who has actually understood Him surrenders unto Him after many, many births. We find all these qualifications in the Pracetās. They underwent severe austerities and penances within the water, and they did not take any food for a very long time. They practiced these austerities not for material benediction but for the satisfaction of the Supreme Lord. One may engage in any business—material or spiritual—but the purpose should be the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This verse presents a perfect picture of Vedic civilization. People training to become devotees should be respectful not only to the Supreme Personality of Godhead but also to those who are elderly in knowledge, who are Āryans and actual devotees of the Lord. An Āryan is one who does not boast, but is an actual devotee of the Lord. <span class="Italic">Āryan</span> means “advanced.” Formerly, those who claimed to be Āryans had to be devotees of the Lord. For instance, in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (2.2) Kṛṣṇa chastised Arjuna by saying that he was speaking like a non-Āryan.
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div class="Verse-in-purp">śrī-bhagavān uvāca<br>kutas tvā kaśmalam idaṁ<br>viṣame samupasthitam<br>anārya-juṣṭam asvargyam<br>akīrti-karam arjuna</div></blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “The Supreme Person [Bhagavān] said: My dear Arjuna, how have these impurities come upon you? They are not at all befitting a man who knows the progressive values of life. They do not lead to higher planets, but to infamy.” Arjuna, the <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> was refusing to fight despite being directly ordered by the Supreme Lord. He was thus chastised by the Lord as belonging to a non-Āryan family. Anyone who is advanced in the devotional service of the Lord certainly knows his duty. It does not matter whether his duty is violent or nonviolent. If it is sanctioned and ordered by the Supreme Lord, it must be performed. An Āryan performs his duty. It is not that the Āryans are unnecessarily inimical to living entities. The Āryans never maintain slaughterhouses, and they are never enemies of poor animals. The Pracetās underwent severe austerities for many, many years, even within the water. Accepting austerities and penances is the avowed business of those interested in advanced civilization.
          </p>
          <p>
            The word <span class="Italic">nirandhasām</span> means “without food.” Eating voraciously and unnecessarily is not the business of an Āryan. Rather, the eating process should be restricted as far as possible. When Āryans eat, they eat only prescribed eatables. Regarding this, the Lord says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.26):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">patraṁ puṣpaṁ phalaṁ toyaṁ<br>yo me bhaktyā prayacchati<br>tad ahaṁ bhakty-upahṛtam<br>aśnāmi prayatātmanaḥ</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “If one offers Me with love and devotion a leaf, a flower, fruit or water, I will accept it.” Thus there are restrictions for the advanced Āryans. Although the Lord Himself can eat anything and everything, He restricts Himself to vegetables, fruits, milk and so on. This verse thus describes the activities of those who claim to be Āryans.

            Dear Lord, even great yogīs and mystics who are very much advanced by virtue of austerities and knowledge and who have completely situated themselves in pure existence, as well as great personalities like Manu, Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva, cannot fully understand Your glories and potencies. Nonetheless they have offered their prayers according to their own capacities. In the same way, we, although much lower than these personalities, also offer our prayers according to our own capability.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="verse_purport_content collapse" id="verse_41_purport">
          <p>
            Lord Brahmā, Lord Śiva, Manu (the father of mankind), great saintly persons and also great sages who have elevated themselves to the transcendental platform through austerities and penance, as well as devotional service, are imperfect in knowledge compared to the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is the case with anyone within this material world. No one can be equal to the Supreme Lord in anything, certainly not in knowledge. Consequently, anyone’s prayer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead is never complete. It is not possible to measure the complete glories of the Supreme Lord, who is unlimited. Even the Lord Himself in His incarnation as Ananta, or Śeṣa, cannot describe His own glories. Although Ananta has many thousands of faces and has been glorifying the Lord for many, many years, He could not find the limit of the glories of the Lord. Thus it is not possible to estimate the complete potencies and glories of the Supreme Lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            Nonetheless, everyone in devotional service can offer essential prayers to the Lord. Everyone is situated in a relative position, and no one is perfect in glorifying the Lord. Beginning with Lord Brahmā and Lord Śiva down to ourselves, everyone is the servant of the Supreme Lord. We are all situated in relative positions according to our own <span class="Italic">karma.</span> Yet every one of us can offer prayers with heart and soul as far as we can appreciate the Lord’s glories. That is our perfection. Even when one is in the darkest region of existence, he is allowed to offer prayers to the Lord according to his own capacity. The Lord therefore says in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.32):
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">
            <div class="Verse-in-purp">māṁ hi pārtha vyapāśritya<br>ye ’pi syuḥ pāpa-yonayaḥ<br>striyo vaiśyās tathā śūdrās<br>te ’pi yānti parāṁ gatim</div>
            </div>
            </blockquote>
          </p>
          <p>
            “O son of Pṛthā, those who take shelter in Me, though they be of lower birth—women, <span class="Italic">vaiśyas</span> [merchants], as well as <span class="Italic">śūdras</span> [workers]—can approach the supreme destination.”
          </p>
          <p>
            If one seriously accepts the lotus feet of the Lord, he is purified by the grace of the Lord and by the grace of the Lord’s servant. This is confirmed by Śukadeva Gosvāmī: <span class="Italic">ye ’nye ca pāpā yad-apāśrayāśrayāḥ śudhyanti tasmai prabhaviṣṇave namaḥ</span> (<span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāg.</span> 2.4.18). One who is brought under the lotus feet of the Lord by the endeavor of the Lord’s servant, the spiritual master, is certainly immediately purified, however lowborn he may be. He becomes eligible to return home, back to Godhead.

            The Supreme Personality of Godhead is known as Vāsudeva because He lives everywhere. The word <span class="Italic">vas</span> means “to live.” As stated in <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā, eko ’py asau racayituṁ jagad-aṇḍa-koṭim: [Bs. </span>5.35] the Lord, through His plenary portion, enters into each and every universe to create the material manifestation. He also enters into each and every heart in all living entities and into each and every atom also (<span class="Italic">paramāṇu-cayāntara-stham</span>). Because the Supreme Lord lives everywhere, He is known as Vāsudeva. Although He lives everywhere within the material world, He is not contaminated by the modes of nature. The Lord is therefore described in <span class="Italic">Īśopaniṣad</span> as <span class="Italic">apāpa-viddham.</span> He is never contaminated by the modes of material nature. When the Lord descends on this planet, He acts in many ways. He kills demons and performs acts not sanctioned by the Vedic principles, that is, acts considered sinful. Even though He acts in such a way, He is never contaminated by His action. He is therefore described herein as <span class="Italic">śuddha,</span> meaning “always free from contamination.” The Lord is also <span class="Italic">sama,</span> equal to everyone. In this regard, He states in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (9.29), <span class="Italic">samo’haṁ sarva-bhūteṣu na me dveṣyo ’sti na priyaḥ:</span> the Lord has no one as His friend or enemy, and He is equal to everyone.

            The word <span class="Italic">anapavarga-vīrya</span> is significant in this verse. The word <span class="Italic">ana</span> means “without,” <span class="Italic">pavarga</span> means “the materialistic way of life,” and <span class="Italic">vīrya</span> means “prowess.” The prowess of the Supreme Personality of Godhead always contains six basic opulences, one of which is renunciation. Although the Pracetās desired to see the Lord to their full satisfaction, the Lord left. According to Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī, this is an exhibition of His kindness to innumerable other devotees. Although He was being attracted by the Pracetās, He left. This is an example of His renunciation. This renunciation was also exhibited by Lord Caitanya Mahāprabhu when He stayed with Advaita Prabhu after taking <span class="Italic">sannyāsa.</span> All the devotees there wanted Him to stay a few days longer, but Lord Caitanya left without hesitation. The conclusion is that although the Supreme Lord has unlimited kindness for His devotees, He is not attached to anyone. He is equally kind to His innumerable devotees all over the creation.

            King Prācīnabarhiṣat left his kingdom before his sons arrived after their execution of penance and austerity. The sons, the Pracetās, were ordered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead to come out of the water and go to the kingdom of their father in order to take care of that kingdom. However, when they came out, they saw that everything had been neglected due to the King’s absence. They first observed that food grains were not being produced and that there were no agricultural activities. Indeed, the surface of the world was practically covered by very tall trees. It seemed as though the trees were determined to stop people from going into outer space to reach the heavenly kingdoms. The Pracetās became very angry when they saw the surface of the globe covered in this way. They desired that the land be cleared for crops.

            It is not a fact that jungles and trees attract clouds and rain, because we find rainfall over the sea. Human beings can inhabit any place on the surface of the earth by clearing jungles and converting land for agricultural purposes. People can keep cows, and all economic problems can be solved in that way. One need only work to produce grains and take care of the cows. The wood found in the jungles may be used for constructing cottages. In this way the economic problem of humanity can be solved. At the present moment there are many vacant lands throughout the world, and if they are properly utilized, there will be no scarcity of food. As far as rain is concerned, it is the performance of <span class="Italic">yajña</span> that attracts rain. As stated in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhagavad-gītā</span> (3.14):

            Whenever there is some uncommon occurrence on any planet, Lord Brahmā, being in charge of the whole universe, immediately comes to control the situation. Lord Brahmā also came when Hiraṇyakaśipu underwent severe penances and austerities and made the whole universe tremble. A responsible man in any establishment is always alert to keep peace and harmony within the establishment. Similarly, Lord Brahmā is also allowed to keep peace and harmony within this universe. He consequently pacified the sons of King Barhiṣmān with good logic.

            The daughter of the trees is referred to in text 13 of this chapter. This daughter was born of Kaṇḍu and Pramlocā. The society girl Pramlocā, after giving birth to the child, immediately left for the heavenly kingdom. While the child was crying, the king of the moon took compassion upon her and saved her by putting his finger into her mouth. This child was cared for by the trees, and when she grew up, by the order of Lord Brahmā, she was delivered to the Pracetās as their wife. The name of the girl was Māriṣā, as the next verse will explain. It was the predominating deity of the trees that delivered the daughter. In this connection, Śrīla Jīva Gosvāmī Prabhupāda states, <span class="Italic">vṛkṣāḥ tad-adhiṣṭhātṛ-devatāḥ:</span> “The ‘trees’ means the controlling deity of those trees.” In Vedic literatures we find that there is a controlling deity of the water; similarly, there is a controlling deity of the trees. The Pracetās were engaged in burning all the trees to ashes, and they considered the trees their enemies. To pacify the Pracetās, the predominating deity of the trees, under the advice of Lord Brahmā, delivered the daughter Māriṣā.

            Following the order of Lord Brahmā, all the Pracetās accepted the girl as their wife. From the womb of this girl, the son of Lord Brahmā named Dakṣa took birth. Dakṣa had to take birth from the womb of Māriṣā due to his disobeying and disrespecting Lord Mahādeva [Śiva]. Consequently he had to give up his body twice.

            In this connection the word <span class="Italic">mahad-avajñānāt</span> is significant. King Dakṣa was the son of Lord Brahmā; therefore in a previous birth he was a <span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa,</span> but because of his behaving like a non-<span class="Italic">brāhmaṇa</span> (<span class="Italic">abrāhmaṇa</span>) by insulting or disrespecting Lord Mahādeva, he had to take birth within the semen of a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya.</span> That is to say, he became the son of the Pracetās. Not only that, but because of his disrespecting Lord Śiva, he had to undergo the tribulation of taking birth from within the womb of a woman. In the Dakṣa-yajña arena, he was once killed by Lord Śiva’s servant, Vīrabhadra. Because that was not sufficient, he again took birth, from the womb of Māriṣā. At the end of the Dakṣa-yajña and the disastrous incidents there, Dakṣa offered his prayer to Lord Śiva. Although he had to give up his body and take birth from the womb of a woman impregnated by the semen of a <span class="Italic">kṣatriya,</span> he received all opulence by the grace of Lord Śiva. These are the subtle laws of material nature. Unfortunately, people in this modern age do not know how these laws are working. Having no knowledge of the eternity of the spirit soul and its transmigration, the population of the present age is in the greatest ignorance. Because of this, it is said in <span class="Ref_Italic">Bhāgavatam</span> (1.1.10): <span class="Italic">mandāḥ sumanda-matayo manda-bhāgyā hy upadrutāḥ.</span> The total population in this age of Kali-yuga is very bad, lazy, unfortunate and disturbed by material conditions.

          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            “By human calculation, a thousand ages taken together is the duration of Brahmā’s one day. And such also is the duration of his night.” Brahmā’s one day consists of one thousand cycles of the four <span class="Italic">yugas</span>—Satya, Tretā, Dvāpara and Kali. In that one day there are fourteen <span class="Italic">manvantaras,</span> and out of these <span class="Italic">manvantaras</span> this Cākṣuṣa <span class="Italic">manvantara</span> is the sixth. The various Manus existing in one day of Lord Brahmā are as follows: (1) Svāyambhuva, (2) Svārociṣa, (3) Uttama, (4) Tāmasa, (5) Raivata, (6) Cākṣuṣa, (7) Vaivasvata, (8) Sāvarṇi, (9) Dakṣasāvarṇi, (10) Brahma-sāvarṇi, ( 11) Dharma-sāvarṇi, (12) Rudra-sāvarṇi, (13) Deva-sāvarṇi and (14) Indra-sāvarṇi.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus there are fourteen Manus in one day of Brahmā. In a year there are 5,040 Manus. Brahmā has to live for one hundred years; consequently, the total of Manus appearing and disappearing during the life of one Brahmā is 504,000. This is the calculation for one universe, and there are innumerable universes. All these Manus come and go simply by the breathing process of Mahā-Viṣṇu. As stated in the <span class="Italic">Brahma-saṁhitā:</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <blockquote><div style=" margin-top: 0.125in">

            The word <span class="Italic">jagad-aṇḍa-nātha</span> means Lord Brahmā. There are innumerable <span class="Italic">jagad-aṇḍa-nātha</span> Brahmās, and thus we can calculate the many Manus. The present age is under the control of Vaivasvata Manu. Each Manu lives 4,320,000 years multiplied by 71. The present Manu has already lived for 4,320,000 years multiplied by 28. All these long life-spans are ultimately ended by the laws of material nature. The controversy of the Dakṣa-yajña took place in the Svāyambhuva <span class="Italic">manvantara</span> period. As a result, Dakṣa was punished by Lord Śiva, but by virtue of his prayers to Lord Śiva he became eligible to regain his former opulence. According to Viśvanātha Cakravartī Ṭhākura, Dakṣa underwent severe penances up to the fifth <span class="Italic">manvantara.</span> Thus at the beginning of the sixth <span class="Italic">manvantara,</span> known as the Cākṣuṣa <span class="Italic">manvantara,</span> Dakṣa regained his former opulence by the blessings of Lord Śiva.

            After being born, Dakṣa, by the superexcellence of his bodily luster, covered all others’ bodily opulence. Because he was very expert in performing fruitive activity, he was called by the name Dakṣa, meaning “the very expert.” Lord Brahmā therefore engaged Dakṣa in the work of generating living entities and maintaining them. In due course of time, Dakṣa also engaged other Prajāpatis [progenitors] in the process of generation and maintenance.

            Dakṣa became almost as powerful as Lord Brahmā. Consequently, Lord Brahmā engaged him in generating population. Dakṣa was very influential and opulent. In his own turn, Dakṣa engaged other Prajāpatis, headed by Marīci. In this way the population of the universe increased.
